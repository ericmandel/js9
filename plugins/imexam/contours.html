<h3>Contours</h3>

Contours levels can be overlaid on the displayed image.

<p>
The <b>N</b> entry box controls the number of contours levels to draw.

<p>
Pressing the <b>Draw Contours</b> button will draw contours at the image levels
currently listed in the <b>Levels:</b> list.

<p>
Pressing the <b>Set Min/Max</b> button will fill in the min and max entry boxes
from the minimum and maximum values of the image.

<p>
Pressing the <b>Make Levels</b> will fill in the levels list with an evenly
spaced list of level values from min to max excluding the min and max values
themselves.

<p>
The <b>Binning</b> option allows the image data to be binned before
the contours are computed.  Contours will be computed more quickly for
binned images.  However, binning will cause the positions of the contours
to be less accurate.

<p>
The <b>Smooth</b> option causes the image data to be smoothed by a Gaussian kernel
with the specified sigma number of pixels before the contours are computed.
This technique often is necessary to achieve good results for sparse data
(e.g. event files).  However, it can affect the accuracy of the contours.

<p>
The <b>Quality</b> radio button chooses between one of two contouring methods.
The faster option selects contours with up to 4 points per pixel.  The quality
option selects contours with up to 8 points to pixel.
