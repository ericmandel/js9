<h3>Separate and Gather Images</h3>

<p>
The <b>Separate and Gather Images</b> plugin allows you to separate
selected images or all images into independent JS9 displays. The
topmost (selected) image remains in place, and new displays are
created for the others. The presence or absence of a menubar,
toolbar, and colorbar in the topmost image will be replicated in the
new displays.

<p>
You also can gather selected images or all images into the current
display.

<p>
When separating images, the plugin allows you to choose between three layouts:
<ul>
<li> horizontal: one row starting to the right of the first display
<li> vertical: one column underneath the first display
<li> auto: layout horizontally so long as half of each subsequent
display is visible, then start a new row
</ul>

<p>
The options to <b>separate all</b> and <b>gather all</b> images can
also be found in the <b>File</b> menu (using the <b>auto</b> layout).
