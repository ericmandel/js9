<h3><A NAME="regions">JS9/DS9/Funtools Spatial Regions</A></h3>
In many X-ray astronomical analysis software suites (e.g., fitsio, ciao,
funtools), spatial regions allow one to select sections of an image or
rows of a table by means of simple geometric shapes.  When an image is
filtered, only pixels found within these shapes are processed. When a
table is filtered, only rows found within these shapes are processed.

<p>
In these systems, spatial region filtering is accomplished by means
of <b>region specifications</b>. Typically, region specifications use
bracket notation appended to the filename of the data being processed:
<pre>
  funcnts "foo.fits[circle(512,512,100)]"
</pre>

<p>
JS9 implements a subset of the widely-used DS9/Funtools regions syntax,
as described below.

<h3>Region Expressions</h3>

Spatial region specifications consist of one or more lines containing:
<pre>
  # comment until end of line
  # each region expression contains shapes and optional local json objects
  [region_expression1] {local json object}  # tags
  [region_expression2] # tags
</pre>

<p>
A single region expression consists of:
<pre>
  # shape name and parens are required
  # arguments are separated by commas. spaces are optional, as is the + sign
  [+-]shape(val, val, ...)
</pre>
where regions shapes can be:

<pre>
  shape:        arguments:
  -----         ----------------------------------------
  annulus       (xcenter, ycenter, inner_radius, outer_radius)
  box           (xcenter, ycenter, xwidth, yheight[, angle])
  circle        (xcenter, ycenter, radius)
  ellipse       (xcenter, ycenter, xwidth, yheight[, angle])
  text          (x1, x2, text)
  point         (x1, y1)
  polygon       (x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn yn)
</pre>
Note that other keyword keywords (e.g., the DS9 "global" keyword and
DS9/Funtools region shapes not yet implemented in JS9) are silently ignored.

<p>
All arguments to regions are real values; integer values are
automatically converted to real where necessary.  All angles are in
degrees and run from the positive image x-axis to the positive image
y-axis.

<h3>Region Exclusion</h3>
<p>
Shapes also can be globally excluded from a region descriptor by using
a minus sign before a region:

<pre>
  operator      arguments:
  --------      -----------
  -             Globally exclude the region expression following '-' sign
                from ALL regions specified in this file
</pre>

<h3>Local Properties of Regions</h3>
DS9/Funtools regions utilize a key=value syntax within an in-line comment to
specify secondary properties such as color. It also uses single tokens
in the in-line comments to specify tags such as "source" and "background".
<p>
JS9 retains the use of comments to specify tags, but utilizes a JSON
object to specify secondary properties. This optional object follows
the region specification:
<pre>
    point(4300.00, 4250.00) {"color": "red"} # background,include
    point(350.897859, 58.835164) {"ptshape": "circle", "ptsize": 5}
</pre>
See the JS9.Regions.opts object in the JS9 source code for a list of properties
that can be passed in this JSON object.

<h3> Coordinate Systems</h3>

For each region, it is important to specify the coordinate system
used to interpret the region, i.e., to set the context in which position and
size values are interpreted. For this purpose, the following keywords
are recognized:

<pre>
  name                  description
  ----                  ------------------------------------------
  physical              pixel coords of original file using LTM/LTV
  image                 pixel coords of current file
  FK4                   sky coordinate system
  FK5                   sky coordinate system
  galactic              sky coordinate system
  ecliptic              sky coordinate system
  ICRS                  currently same as J2000
</pre>
If no coordinate system is specified, physical is assumed.  The
coordinate system specifier should appear at the beginning of the
region description, separated by semi-colon, or on a separate line.
Note that multiple coordinate systems can be in the same
specifier. Each one pertains to the region following until the next
coordinate system is defined:
<pre>
  # Region file format: JS9 version 1.0
  ICRS
  point(23:23:27.815, +58:48:42.017)
  box(23:23:27.815, +58:48:42.017, 29.51", 29.51", 0.000)
  physical
  ellipse(4300.00, 4250.00, 30.00, 20.00, 0.00)
  box(4300.00, 4250.00, 60.00, 60.00, 0.00)
  ICRS
  circle(350.897859, 58.835164, 0.76')
  ellipse(350.897859, 58.835164, 14.76", 9.84", 0.000)
</pre>

<p>
<h3>Specifying Positions, Sizes, and Angles</h3>

The arguments to region shapes can be floats or integers describing
positions and sizes.  They can be specified as pure numbers or using
explicit formatting directives:

<pre>
  position arguments    description
  ------------------    ------------------------------
  [num]                 context-dependent (see below)
  [num]d                degrees
  [num]r                radians
  [num]p                physical pixels
  [num]i                image pixels
  [num]:[num]:[num]     hms for 'odd' position arguments
  [num]:[num]:[num]     dms for 'even' position arguments
  [num]h[num]m[num]s    explicit hms
  [num]d[num]m[num]s    explicit dms

  size arguments        description
  --------------        -----------
  [num]                 context-dependent (see below)
  [num]"                arc seconds
  [num]'                arc minutes
  [num]d                degrees
  [num]r                radians
</pre>
When a "pure number" (i.e. one without a format directive such as 'd'
for 'degrees') is specified, its interpretation depends on the context
defined by the 'coordsys' keyword. In general, the rule is:

<p>
<b>All pure numbers have implied units corresponding to the current
coordinate system.
</b>

<p>
If no such system is explicitly specified, the default system is
implicitly assumed to be PHYSICAL. In practice this all means that for
IMAGE and PHYSICAL systems, pure numbers are pixels. Otherwise, for
all systems, pure numbers are degrees.
