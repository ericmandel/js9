<h3>Do You Need a Server-side Helper? Which One?</h3>  

JS9 supports server-side analysis on FITS data, allowing you to
execute virtually any command-line analysis program from JS9, run that
analysis command on the server, and view results on your web page. It
also can support external communication with JS9 (via the shell and
Python) and handle the display of large files.

<p>
The server-side analysis capability is useful for archive centers and
individual users who want to integrate their own data analysis
programs into JS9. You configure a JS9 server-side helper by adding
additional switches to the configure command described in
<a href="./install.html">Installing JS9</a>.

<p>
JS9 supports two mechanisms for server-side analysis: you can run a
separate Node.js-based server to process requests using WebSockets, or
use CGI calls to your own web server.  The Node.js server-side helper
is the recommended method: it is faster and more flexible than the CGI
helper: in addition to analysis tasks, Node-js-based helper also supports:
<ul>
<li><a href="./extmsg.html">command-line messaging</a> between the shell and JS9
<li><a href="./python.html">pyjs9 messaging</a> between the Python and JS9
<li>large-file support via the use of <a href="./repfile.html">representation files</a>
</ul>

<h3>Add Switches to Configure the Server-side Helper</h3>
<p>
JS9 is built using the standard GNU <b>./configure; make; make
install</b> method. To configure server-side analysis, you
add switches to the configure command line. The most important switches are:
<pre>
--with-helper=[type]    type of helper: nodejs (for Node.js) , get (for CGI)
--prefix=[path]         location to install the non-web programs and scripts
--with-cfitsio=[path]   cfitsio location for building js9helper, e.g. /usr/local
</pre>
Other less-used switches are:
<pre>
--with-cgidir=[path]     cgi install directory e.g. /var/www/public_html/cgi-bin
--with-cgiurl=[url]      cgi url relative to the web root, e.g. ./cgi-bin/js9
--with-cgixpath=[dirs]   directories to add to cgi path
--with-png=[path]        directory containing lib/png to build tpos, e.g. /usr/local
</pre>

<p>
Both the Node.js and CGI helpers make use of a C program called
<b>js9helper</b> to handle certain types of JS9 requests.  To support
extraction of FITS representation files from large FITS files,
js9helper must be linked against the cfitsio library (version 3.39 or
later is preferred).  Cfitsio is the de facto standard FITS library
and is available from NASA/HEASARC at the Goddard Space Flight Center:
<pre>
    https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html
</pre>
To tell configure where cfitsio libraries are located, use the
--with-cfitsio=[dir] switch, e.g. --with-cfitsio=/usr/local will find
the cfitsio libraries in /usr/local/lib and include files in
/usr/local/include.  If cfitsio is not used in the build, the js9helper will
still support server-side analysis, but will not support representation files.

<p>
Note that the non-web files, programs, and scripts (e.g., js9helper)
will be installed in accordance with the standard GNU
<b>--prefix=[dir]</b> switch. The default is /usr/local.

<p>
Example configure commands are shown below for a typical Linux Apache setup
(using CGI) and for a personal Mac setup (using Node.js):
<pre>
  linux-cgi)
  ./configure 	--prefix=/soft/saord					\
		--with-helper=get					\
		--with-webdir=/var/www/htdocs/js9			\
		--with-cgidir=/var/www/cgi-bin/js9			\
		--with-cgiurl=./cgi-bin/js9				\
		--with-cgixpath=/soft/saord/bin				\
		--with-cfitsio=/soft/saord				\
  		CC=gcc $*

  mac-nodejs)
  ./configure 	--prefix=$HOME						\
		--with-helper=nodejs					\
		--with-webdir=/Users/me/Sites/js9			\
		--with-cfitsio=/Users/me/soft				\
		CC=gcc $*

</pre>
In these examples, the JS9 web files (JavaScript, CSS etc.) will be
installed in a js9 sub-directory of htdocs in the /var/www directory
or in the Mac user's personal Sites directory.  JS9 CGI files will be
installed in a subdirectory of the cgi-bin directory. C programs and
shell scripts will be installed in sub-directories of the user's home
directory or the system-wide /soft/saord directory.

<h3>Build the JS9 System</h3>
<p> Once the configure arguments are set up, you run configure, etc.
as described in the basic install instructions at:
<a href="./install.html">Installing JS9</a>.
<p>
Some additional notes on getting the server-side helpers working are
added below.

<h3>Adding Analysis Tasks</h3>
<p>
When configuring server-side analysis, you add server-side analysis tasks
to JS9 (or change the default analysis tasks) by adding or modifying
json files in the <b>analysis-plugins</b> directory (and optionally,
by adding wrapper files to the <b>analysis-wrappers</b> directory.)
See <a href="serverside.html">Server-based Tasks</a> for a description of
how to configure server-side analysis tasks for your site.

<h3>Notes on Installing the Node.js-based Server-side helper</h3>
<p>
The Node.js server-side helper is noticeably faster than CGI. It also
offers more power and flexibility, e.g., the node server supports
external control of the browser from the command line via the
<b>js9 script</b> and it's underlying <b>js9Msg</b> facility
(see <a href="./extmsg.html">External Messaging with JS9</a> for
more information). However, Node.js requires that you open another
internet port to the outside world.

Node is available at:
<pre>
    http://nodejs.org/
</pre>
Please install Node.js version 6 or above (some versions of Linux
come with version 4, which will not work). Once installed, you must
start the server-side helper from the JS9 web install directory,
i.e. the location where you installed (among other things) js9.js and
the node_modules directory:
<pre>
    # in the bash shell:
    node js9Helper.js 1>~/logs/js9node.log 2>&1 &
    # or, in the tcsh shell:
    node js9Helper.js >& ~/logs/js9node.log &
</pre>
Unlike CGI, Node can be run as any user: it does not have to be run as
the http daemon user. It certainly should not be run as root! We run
it as a non-privileged user with sufficient permissions to run
analysis programs. In any case, it should be run with its Unix PATH
set to include the directory containing the JS9 helper program, as
well as any analysis programs that will be executed by the JS9
server-side helper when requested by the client. The PATH also should
include the directories housing standard Unix tools such as awk, sed,
grep, and echo.

<p>
For security reasons, the log file should be created outside the web
server directory structure.

<p>
If you are running in a secure environment (i.e. your web pages use
<b>https</b> protocol instead of <b>http</b>), then node server also
must be run securely.  This is because modern browsers block "active
mixed content".  To run the Node.js helper using https protocol
instead of http, create a js9Secure.json file containing path names to
your private key, certificate, and certificate authority files:
<pre>
  {
      "key":  "/path/to/private.key",
      "cert": "/path/to/server.certificate",
      "ca":   "/path/to//certifcate.authority"
  }
</pre>
This file will reside in the directory in which the Node.js helper is started.
<p>
<b>It is imperative that you keep your private key file secure!</b> If
this key is accessed by unauthorized parties, they can masquerade as
your site. The standard recommendation is to change files permission so
that only the Node.js user can read it:
<pre>
   chmod 400 private.key
</pre>
and keep that user's password safe!

<h3>Setting up a proxy for the Node.js-based  helper</h3>

<p>
Clients will automatically connect to the Node.js helper when an image
is loaded into JS9. The server-side helper listens on a port specified
in the js9Prefs.json file by the <b>globalOpts.helperPort</b> value. The
default is 2718, but you can change this to any open port.

<p>
For example, some institutions do not allow non-standard ports to be
open on public-facing hosts.  In such a case, the Node.js-based helper
can change its port to a standard port allowed by that institution
(e.g. 8080 or 8000). This can be done by simply changing
the <b>helperPort</b> property in js9prefs.js (for the client) and
js9Prefs.json (for the helper).

<p>
But sometimes even this is not permitted: instead, the Node.js helper is
required to run as a non-public server.  For this situation, you can
set up a proxy to pass TCP packets from a public-facing host to the
helper running on a non-public host. The issues surrounding
proxying the helper's underlying <a href="https://socket.io/">socket.io</a>
library are discussed in detail in this
<a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/1696">issue</a>
and in this
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36472920/apache-proxy-configuration-for-socket-io-project-not-in-root">stackoverflow discussion</a>.

<p>
tl;dnr: a variation of the following httpd.conf configuration should
work for most Apache web servers:
<pre>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/socket.io            [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket    [NC]
RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://otherhost:2718/$1 [P,L]

ProxyPass        /socket.io http://otherhost:2718/socket.io
ProxyPassReverse /socket.io http://otherhost:2718/socket.io
</pre>
<p>
NB: when configuring a proxy, you should set the "helperPort" in
js9prefs.js to 80 (or whatever port your web server listens on) so
that the browser connects to the helper via the public-facing web
server. Set the "helperPort" in js9Prefs.json to 2718 (or whatever
port you choose), so that the helper listens on its own port. This is
a special situation where the ports will be different for the client
and the helper.

<h3>Notes on the CGI-based Server-side helper</h3>

<p>
If you want to utilize a CGI-based
helper, you <b>must</b> specify the <b>--with-cgidir</b>
and <b>--with-cgiurl</b> switches on the configure command
line. Optionally, you also can specify the
<b>--with-cgixpath</b> switch if you want to add directories to the CGI path:

<ul>
<li>The <b>--with-cgidir</b> switch specifies the directory into which to
install the js9Helper.cgi wrapper script. That script is generated by
the build. All CGI requests are processed through this js9Helper.cgi wrapper.

<li>The <b>--with-cgiurl</b> switch specifies the URL of the
js9Helper.cgi script <b>relative</b> to your web document root. The
value of this switch is combined with the CGI wrapper filename and the
result stored in the js9Prefs.json file, telling JS9 how to call the
CGI helper script.

<li>The <b>--with-cgxpath</b> switch specifies a semi-colon delimited
list of directories to add to the CGI path. You can use this switch to
make accessible the executables that will be used in your CGI
processing. Of course, setting up the CGI path also can be done in
many ways, e.g., inside your analysis wrapper scripts or even in the
web server itself.
</ul>

<p>
After the build is complete, the <b>globalOpts.helperType</b> variable
in the <b>js9Prefs.json</b> file should have a value of "get" and JS9
will send messages via the specified CGI command, utilizing the
js9Helper.cgi script.

<p>
Of course, you must now ensure that your web server can run the
js9Helper.cgi script successfully to execute JS9 CGI commands. Normal
web debugging techniques come into play here: check the CGI section of
your web server's configuration file and review the web access and
error logs. If you continue to have problems, please let us know and
we will try to help.

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes</h3>

<p>
<b>DEPRECATED:</b> For <b>fits2png</b> processing, the build of the
JS9 server-side tpos program (which converts FITS files to the PNG
representation file) requires the libpng library. If libpng is not
already installed on your system, it is available at:
<pre>
    http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
</pre>
Of course, Linux users can install libpng in the "usual way", e.g. for CentOS:
<pre>
    sudo yum install libpng-devel
</pre>
Any relatively modern version of the png library should suffice
(subject to security fixes, etc.) 
<p>
In any case, to build tpos, you must tell configure where to look for
the png libraries and include files using the <b>--with-png=[dir]</b> switch.]
