<h3>The JS9 Public API</h3>

<p>
The JS9 Public API provides a JavaScript programming interface for
interacting with JS9. Obviously, all of JS9 JavaScript code is
available to you within a web page, but the public API is designed to
stable and well-documented for users and web designers. It also will
provide the basis for planned language bindings (Python, perhaps C/Fortran.)
<p>
In general, the public API routines act on the current image being
displayed in the default JS9 display (i.e., the HTML div element that
defines the JS9 display.) Since most web pages will have only a single
JS9 display, this behavior is usually what you want. It parallels
DS9's behavior in which XPA commands act on the currently displayed
image. For example, to change the colormap of the current image, use:
<pre>
    JS9.SetColormap("cool");
</pre>

<p>
However, for cases where multiple JS9 displays are defined on a
single page, you can specify the specific display to process by
adding an <b> display object</b> argument to the calling sequence with
a single <b>display</b> property:
<pre>
    {display: [display_id]}
</pre>
where [display_id] is the id of the target JS9 display (i.e. the id of
the HTML div element.) For example, if two JS9 displays with ids "JS9"
and "myJS9", respectively, are present on a single web page, you can
set the colormap of the second one this way:
<pre>
    JS9.SetColormap("cool", {display: "myJS9"})
</pre>
Note that this <b>display object</b> contains only the <b>display</b>
property and always is specified as the final argument in a call.
<p>
For image-based API routines (not display-based routines with names ending in
<b>Display</b>, e.g.,
<a href="#JS9.ResizeDisplay">JS9.ResizeDisplay</a> or
<a href="#JS9.BlendDisplay">JS9.BlendDisplay</a>), the
display property can specify an image handle or image id instead of a
JS9 display id. When the image handle in question points to the currently
displayed image, this alternate usage is nothing more than a trivial
optimization.  Thus, to call a routine such as
<a href="#JS9.WCSToPix">JS9.WCSToPix()</a>
or
<a href="#JS9.PixToWCS">JS9.PixtoWCS()</a>:
<pre>
    var im = JS9.GetImage({display: "myJS9"});
    for(i=0; i&lt;1000; i++){
      x = ...
      y = ... 
      wcs = JS9.PixtoWCS(x, y, {display: im});
      console.log("%s %s -> %s %s", x, y, wcs.ra, wcs.dec);
    }
</pre>
However, the image handle does not need to point to the currently
displayed image. When it does not, the public routine will act on the
image associated with the image handle, not the current image.  In
particular, you can use
<a href="#JS9.LookupImage"><b>JS9.LookupImage()</b></a>
to get the image
handle of any image, and then act on that image. For example, if two
images, foo1.fits and foo2.fits, are loaded into a JS9 display, and
foo1.fits is currently being displayed, you can close foo2.fits this way:
<pre>
    var im = JS9.LookupImage("foo2.fits");
    if( im ){
        JS9.CloseImage({display: im});
    }
</pre>
<p>
The optional <b>display object</b> argument generally is not
mentioned in the routines below, but it is always available.

<h4 id="load">Loading Images</h4>

<h5 id="JS9.Load">Load an image into JS9</h5>
<p> 
<code class="api">JS9.Load(url, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>url</b>: url, in-memory FITS, FITS blob, data object
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object or JSON string containing image parameters
</ul>
<p>
Load a FITS file (or a PNG/JPEG file) into JS9. You also can pass
an in-memory buffer containing a FITS file, a blob containing a FITS
file, or a string containing a base64-encoded FITS file. Finally, you
can pass a generic <b>data object</b> containing the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>naxis</b>: number of axes in the image
<li><b>axis</b>: array of image dimensions for each axis or ...
<li><b>naxis[n]</b> image dimensions of each axis (naxis1, naxis2, ...)
<li><b>bitpix</b>: FITS bitpix value
<li><b>head</b>: object containing header keywords as properties
<li><b>image</b>: typed data array containing image data (native format)
<li><b>dmin</b>: data min (optional)
<li><b>dmax</b>: data max (optional)
<li><b>refresh</b>: refresh data when reloading image?
<li><b>allext</b>: load all image extensions?
<li><b>file</b>: set the file property in cases where the url is a script
<li><b>id</b>: set the id property
</ul>
The <a href="#JS9.RefreshImage"><b>JS9.RefreshImage()</b></a>
and <a href="#JS9.Load"><b>JS9.Load()</b></a> routines differ in that
the former always updates the data into an existing image, while the
latter generally adds a completely new image to the display.

<p>
However, in the case where an image already is loaded,
<a href="#JS9.Load"><b>JS9.Load()</b></a> does not reload the image
into a new display: this would initiate another (often time-consuming)
download, resulting in two identical images. Instead, behavior is
dependent on the value of the <b>refresh</b> property passed in opts
(or, if that is not set, by the <b>JS9.globalOpts.reloadRefresh</b>
property), as follows:
<ul>
<li> if <b>refresh</b> is true, the existing image is refreshed
<li> if <b>refresh</b> is false, the existing image is redisplayed
</ul>
The global default is to redisplay instead of refreshing. Site authors can
change this property in <b>js9prefs.js</b>, while users can change this via
the <b>Global</b> tab of the <b>Preferences</b> plugin.
<p>
To override default image parameters, pass the image opts argument:
<pre>
    JS9.Load("data/fits/casa.fits", {scale:"linear", colormap:"sls"});
</pre>
You can also pass a regions property to add regions or load a region file:
<pre>
    # but oh my, its dicey mixing quotes and wcs arcsec/arcmin delims
    JS9.Load("data/fits/casa.fits", {regions:'ICRS; box(23:23:40.340, +58:47:04.059, 29.5", 29.5", 0)'});
    # much easier to pass a filename, if possible
    JS9.Load("data/fits/casa.fits", {regions:"casa/casa.reg"});
</pre>
or a pan position:
<pre>
    # pan to physical coords (usually file coords)
    JS9.Load("data/fits/casa.fits", {px: 4009, py: 3926});
    # pan to ra, dec using file's wcs
    JS9.Load("data/fits/casa.fits", {ra: 350.866689, dec: 58.811671});
    # pan to ra, dec using specified wcs
    JS9.Load("data/fits/casa.fits", {wcs: "23:23:27.942 +58:48:42.02 ICRS"});
</pre>
<p>
If an onload callback function is specified in opts, it will be called
after the image is loaded:
<pre>
    JS9.Load("data/fits/3c273.fits", {scale: "linear", onload: func});
</pre>
The image handle is passed as the first argument to the callback.
<p>
If your url is a function returning a FITS file (e.g. CGI or PHP
script accessing an archive), the filename will end up being the name
of the script, which probably is not what you want. In this case, you
can set the <b>file</b> property explicitly:
<pre>
    JS9.Load("mycgi?FITSFILE=acisf00361N003_evt2.fits", {file:"acisf00361N003_evt2.fits"})
</pre>
Similarly, you can set the <b>id</b> property explicitly (without setting the file) to tailor the id for special needs.
<p>
To load an image into a specified display, pass the <b>display object</b> as the last argument:
<pre>
    JS9.Load("data/fits/3c273.fits", {scale: "linear"}, {display: "myJS9"});
</pre>
<p>
See <a href="./yourdata.html">Displaying Your Data</a> for further discussion of
how to use this routine.

<h5 id="JS9.LoadWindow">Load an image into a light window or a new (separate) window</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.LoadWindow(url, opts, type, html, winopts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>url</b>: url to load
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object or JSON string containing image parameters and/or the display id
<li><b>type</b>: "light" or "new" 
<li><b>html</b>: html for the new page (default is to display a menubar above the image and a colorbar below)
<li><b>winopts</b>: for "light", optional dhtml window options
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: the id of the JS9 display div
</ul>
This routine will load an image into a light-weight window or an entirely new
window. The <b>url</b> and <b>opts</b> arguments are identical to the standard
<a href="#JS9.Load"><b>JS9.Load()</b></a> call,
except that <b>opts</b> can contain:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: string specifying the id of the JS9 display being created.
If no id is specified, a unique id is generated.
<li><b>clone</b>: the id of a display to clone:
the menubar, colorbar, statusbar will be created if and only if they are
present in the cloned display (for light window creation only.)
</ul>
<p>
The <b>type</b> argument determines whether to create a light-weight
window ("light", which is the default) or a new, separate window ("new".)
<p>
By default, the created window will contain a Menubar above a JS9
Display area and a Colorbar below:
<pre>
    &lt;div class='JS9Menubar' id='[id]Menubar'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='JS9' id='[id]'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin-top: 2px;"&gt;
    &lt;div class='JS9Colorbar' id='[id]Colorbar'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
</pre>
You can use the <b>html</b> argument to supply different web page elements
for the window. Furthermore, if you create a light window, a default
set of DynamicDrive dhtmlwindow parameters will be used to make the
window the correct size for the default html:
<pre>
    "width=512px,height=542px,center=1,resize=1,scrolling=1"
</pre>
You can supply your own parameters for the new dhtmlwindow using the
<b>winOpts</b> argument. See:
<a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex8/dhtmlwindow/index.htm" target="_blank">
DynamicDrive</a> for more information about their light-weight window.
<p>
To create a new light window without loading an image, use:
<pre>
    JS9.LoadWindow(null, null, "light");
</pre>
<p>
See js9create.html for examples of how to use this routine.

<h5 id="JS9.LoadProxy">Load an image URL into JS9 using a proxy server</h5>
<p> 
<code class="api">JS9.LoadProxy(url, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>url</b>: remote URL link to load
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object or JSON string containing image parameters
</ul>
<p>
Load a FITS, PNG, or JPEG file specified by an arbitrary URL into JS9 using the
JS9 back-end helper as a proxy server.
<p>
For security reasons, JavaScript contained in one web page can
access data in another web page only if both web pages have the
same origin (i.e., basically coming from the same host.)  This
policy is called the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank">
Same Origin Policy</a>. This means that JS9 cannot load a image files
(i.e., FITS, PNG, or JPG) from an arbitrary URL without using special
techniques.
<p>
One such technique is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" target="_blank">
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>, by which the second server grants
permission to access its image data. Dropbox is CORS-enabled, so that
image files can be loaded directly into JS9. But obviously this requires
that explicit permission be granted by the other server.
<p>
A second technique is to use a proxy server: the URL is not
loaded directly into JS9, but instead is copied back to the
server from which JS9 itself was loaded. The file is then retrieved by
JS9 from this server so that the "same origin" rules are not violated.
<p>
The JS9 Node.js back-end helper can be configured to support
proxy server mode by setting the <b>JS9.globalOpts.loadProxy</b>
property. In addition, the back-end server must be configured to
support temporary working directories for each loaded page by setting
the <b>JS9.globalOpts.workDir</b> property. If the back-end server is
thus configured as a proxy server, JS9 will support the <b>JS9.LoadProxy()</b>
call and allow you to load FITS, PNG, and JPG files from arbitrary URLs. 
JS9 also will display a <b>open link via proxy</b> menu option in the
<b>File</b> menu.
<p>
The <b>JS9.LoadProxy()</b> call takes a URL as its first
argument. This URL will be retrieved using curl or wget and stored on
the back-end server in a directory specifically tied to the web
page. (The directory and its contents will be deleted when the page is
unloaded.) JS9 then will load the file from this directory. Note that
since the file resides on the back-end server, all back-end analysis 
defined on that server is available.
<p>
To override default image parameters, pass the image opts argument:
<pre>
    JS9.LoadProxy("http://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/~eric/coma.fits", {scale:"linear", colormap:"sls"});'
</pre>
<p>
By default, the retrieved file is given a filename based on the base of
the URL. When a gzip'ed file is retrieved, the filename is taken from
the original ungzip'ed file, with a .gz extension added. As an
alternative, you can specify the name of the output file using the <b>ofile</b>
property.
<pre>
    JS9.LoadProxy("http://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-sl/servlet/data-action-aio?obsno=0801931101&name=OEXPMP&level=MT_PPS&extension=FTZ",
                  {ofile: "MP_P0801931101EPX000OEXPMP8000.FIT.gz"})
</pre>

<p>
If an onload callback function is specified in opts, it will be called
after the image is loaded:
<pre>
    JS9.LoadProxy("http://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/~eric/coma.fits", {scale: "linear", onload: func});'
</pre>
The image handle is passed as the first argument to the callback.
<p>
To load an image into a specified display, pass the <b>display object</b> as the last argument:
<pre>
    JS9.LoadProxy("http://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/~eric/coma.fits", {scale: "linear"}, {display: "myJS9"});'
</pre>
<p>
Note again that not all back-end servers support the proxy functionality.
The main 
<a href="https://js9.si.edu" target="_blank">JS9 web site</a> does support proxy service, and
can be used to view images from arbitrary URLs.

<h5 id="JS9.Preload">Load one or more images when the web page is ready</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.Preload(url1, opts1, url2, opts2, ... url2, optsn)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>url</b>: url to load
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object or JSON string containing image parameters
</ul>
This routine will pre-load images into a JS9 display. It can be added
to the web page body element using the onload() JavaScript call or
called in a JavaScript init routine tied to onload. See index.html and
js9preload.html for examples.
<p>
It is worth emphasizing that <b>JS9.Preload()</b> should not be called
until the web page is fully loaded, since JS9 itself is not fully
initialized until then. It is for this reason that <b>JS9.Preload()</b>
generally is called using an onload routine tied to the web page body.

<p>
You can load URLs outside the current web page domain if you are running a
JS9 helper which has enabled the server side <b>Proxy Load</b> capability.
See <a href="serverside.js">Server-side Analysis Tasks</a> for more information.
  
<h5 id="JS9.GetStatus">Get Processing Status</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">status = JS9.GetStatus(type, id)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>type</b>: the type of status
<li><b>id</b>: the id or image handle of the image
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>status</b>: status of processing
</ul>
This routine returns the status of one of the following specified
asynchronous processing types: "Load", "CreateMosaic",
"DisplaySection", "LoadCatalog", "LoadRegions", "ReprojectData",
"RotateData", "RunAnalysis".
<p>
A status of "complete" means that the image is fully processed. Other
statuses include:
<ul>
<li> processing: the image is being processed
<li> loading: the image is in process of loading ("Load" only, for backward compatibility)
<li> error: processing did not complete, due to an error
<li> other: another image is loaded into this display
<li> none: no image is loaded into this display
</ul>
Thus, to check for image load, one can do this in Python:
<pre>
    tfits = "foo.fits"
    hdul = fits.open(tfits)
    ...
    j = JS9()
    j.Load(hdul, tfits)
    while j.GetStatus("load", tfits).strip() != "complete":
        time.sleep(0.1)
    j.SetZoom(2)
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.GetLoadStatus">Get Load Status</h5>
<p> 
<code class="api">status = JS9.GetLoadStatus(id)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: the id or image handle of the file that was loaded into JS9
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>status</b>: status of the load
</ul>
This routine returns the status of the load of this image.
Provided for backward compatibility, it simply calls the more general
<a href="#JS9.GetStatus"><b>JS9.GetStatus()</b></a> routine with
"Load" as the first argument.
<p>
A status of "complete" means that the image is fully loaded. Other
statuses include:
<ul>
<li> loading: the image is in process of loading
<li> error: image did not load due to an error
<li> other: another image is loaded into this display
<li> none: no image is loaded into this display
</ul>
Thus, to check for image load, one can do this in Python:
<pre>
    tfits = "foo.fits"
    hdul = fits.open(tfits)
    ...
    j = JS9()
    j.Load(hdul, tfits)
    while j.GetLoadStatus(tfits) != "complete":
        time.sleep(0.1)
    j.SetZoom(2)
</pre>

<p><hr>
<h4 id="images">Working with Images</h4>

<h5 id="JS9.GetImage">Get image handle for the current image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">im = JS9.GetImage()</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>im</b>: image handle
</ul>
<p>
The routine returns the image handle associated with the current image.
<p>
The returned image handle can be passed in the display object.  This
is marginally more efficient than the default behavior, which is to
determine the current image for each call.

<h5 id="JS9.LookupImage">Lookup an image by id</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">im = JS9.LookupImage(id)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: image id
</ul>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>im</b>: image handle
</ul>
<p>
The <b>JS9.LookupImage()</b> routine takes a string id as input and
returns the image handle of the image having that id (or null.) The id
is the same as is found in the <b>File</b> menu list of displayed images.
This routine is similar to the standard
<a href="#JS9.GetImage"><b>JS9.GetImage()</b></a>
routine, but returns an image by name, regardless of whether it is
currently being displayed.

<p>
You can use this routine, for example, so close an image that is not
currently being displayed. If two images, foo1.fits and foo2.fits, are
loaded into a JS9 display, and foo1.fits is currently being displayed,
you can close foo2.fits this way:
<pre>
    var im = JS9.LookupImage("foo2.fits");
    if( im ){
        JS9.CloseImage({display: im});
    }
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.GetImageData">Get image data and auxiliary info for the specified image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">imdata = JS9.GetImageData(dflag)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dflag</b>: specifies whether the data should also be returned
</ul>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>imdata</b>: image data object
</ul>
<p>
The image data object contains the following information:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: the id of the file that was loaded into JS9
<li><b>file</b>: the file or URL that was loaded into JS9
<li><b>fits</b>: the FITS file associated with this image
<li><b>source</b>: "fits" if a FITS file was loaded, "img" if PNG or JPEG
<li><b>imtab</b>: "image" for FITS images and PNG/JPEG files, "table" for FITS binary tables
<li><b>width</b>: x dimension of image
<li><b>height</b>: y dimension of image
<li><b>fwidth</b>: x dimension of image or fully binned table in original file
<li><b>fheight</b>: y dimension of image or fully binned table in original file
<li><b>dwidth</b>: width of JS9 display (div element)
<li><b>dheight</b>: height of JS9 display (div element)
<li><b>bitpix</b>: FITS bits/pixel of each image element (8 for unsigned char, 16, 32 for signed integer, -32 or -64 for float)
<li><b>bin</b>: current binning factor
<li><b>header</b>: JavaScript object containing FITS header values
<li><b>hdus</b>: JavaScript array containing objects that describe the FITS HDU structure (FITS files only)
<li><b>data</b>: buffer containing raw data values
</ul>
This call can return raw data for subsequent use in local analysis
tasks. The format of the returned data depends on the exact value
of <b>dflag</b>. If <b>dflag</b> is the boolean value true, an HTML5
typed array is returned. In JavaScript, typed arrays are more
efficient than ordinary JavaScript arrays, and, in this case, the
returned data is actually just reference to the real JS9 image data
(so be careful about changing values.)
<p>
If <b>dflag</b> is the string "array", a JavaScript array is returned.
This is not a reference to the real data and will utilize
additional memory, but the values can be manipulated safely.
<p>
If <b>dflag</b> is the string "base64", a base64-encoded string is
returned.  Early on, this seems to be the fastest method of
transferring data via socket.io an external process such as
Python. Currently, the "array" method should generally be used (this
is now the default for the pyjs9 interface to Python.)

<p>
The <b>file</b> the path of the FITS file associated with
this image.

<p>
The <b>header</b> object contains FITS header keywords. Note that all
HISTORY and COMMENT keywords have two underscores and a numeric value
appended, in order to make them unique within the object.

<p>
If you are calling <b>JS9.GetImageData()</b> from an external process (via
the msg protocol), you almost certainly want to set <b>dflag</b> to "array". 
Doing so will serialize the data as an array instead of as an object, saving
a considerable amount of transfer data.
<p>
Given a FITS-standard 1-indexed image pixel x,y, you can find the data value 
at that location using:
<pre>
    val = obj.data[Math.floor(y-0.5) * obj.width + Math.floor(x-0.5)];
</pre>
Note the need to integerize the x and y values: JavaScript arrays are
objects and so floating point array indices do not get truncated
automatically as in C. They will return null values.

<h5 id="JS9.GetDisplayData">Get image data for all images loaded into the specified display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">imarr = JS9.GetDisplayData()</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>imdataArr</b>: array of image data objects
</ul>
<p>
The <b>JS9.GetDisplayData()</b> routine returns an array of image data
objects, one for each images loaded into the specified display.
That is, it returns the same type of information as
<a href="#JS9.GetImageData"><b>JS9.GetImageData()</b></a>,
but does so for each image associated
with the display, not just the current image.

<h5 id="JS9.DisplayImage">Display an image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplayImage(step)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>step</b>: starting step to take when displaying the image
</ul>
The display steps are: "colors" (remake color data when cmap has changed),
"scaled" (rescale data values), "primary" (convert scaled data values
to color values), and "display" (write color values to the web page.)
<p>
The default step is "primary", which displays the image without recalculating
color data, scaled data, etc. This generally is what you want, unless you have
explicitly changed parameter(s) used in a prior step.

<h5 id="JS9.RefreshImage">Re-read the image data and redisplay</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RefreshImage(input, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>input</b>: object, javascript array, typed array, FITS blob, or string
<li><b>opts</b>: optional options or function to call when refresh is complete
</ul>
The <b>RefreshImage</b> routine re-reads image data and updates the
the current image. It can be used, for example, in laboratory settings
where data is being gathered in real-time and the JS9 display needs to
be refreshed periodically. The first <b>input</b> argument can be one
of the following:
<ul>
<li> a text string specifying a new URL to retrieve
<li> a javascript array containing raw image data
<li> a typed array containing raw image data
<li> a blob containing a FITS image file
<li> an object containing a required <b>image</b> property and any of the
following optional properties: 
<ul>
<li><b>naxis</b>: number of axes in the image
<li><b>axis</b>: array of image dimensions for each axis or ...
<li><b>naxis[n]</b>: image dimensions of each axis (naxis1, naxis2, ...)
<li><b>bitpix</b>: FITS bitpix value
<li><b>head</b>: object containing header keywords as properties
<li><b>dmin</b>: data min (optional)
<li><b>dmax</b>: data max (optional)
</ul>
</ul>
A text string passed to the <b>input</b> argument is assumed to be a
URL (or local file pathname) to retrieve and utilize when refreshing
the data in the current image. This option is used, for example, where
an external program rewrites the image file, and the new data are then
used to refresh the display. Note that the specified file becomes the
current image file and will be used for subsequent server-based
analysis request as well as refreshImage() calls with a null input
argument (see next paragraph.)
<p>
If the <b>input</b> argument is null, the current image file is
reloaded, assuming its file path (or URL) is known. For security
reasons, browsers do not expose the path of files loaded via <i>Drag
and Drop</i> or <i>Open Local File</i>. On a local web page, you can
safely use the <b>File -> set this image file's path</b> menu option
to enter the image path here for subsequent reloading (or analysis.)
<p>
When passing an object as <b>input</b>, the required <b>image</b>
property containing the image data can be a javascript array or a
typed data array. It also can contain a base64-encoded string
containing an array. This latter can be useful when calling
JS9.RefreshImage() via HTTP.
<p>
Ordinarily, when refreshing an image, there is no need to specify the
optional axis, bitpix, or header properties.  But note that you actually
can change these values on the fly, and JS9 will process the new data
correctly.  Also, if you do not pass <b>dmin</b> or <b>dmax</b>, they
will be calculated by JS9.
<p>
Note that you can pass a <b>blob</b> containing a complete FITS image to this
routine. The blob will be passed to the underlying FITS-handler before
being displayed. Thus, processing time is slightly greater than if you just
pass the image data directly.
<p>
The second optional argument can be an object containing the following:
<ul>
<li><b>onrefresh</b>: function to perform when refresh is complete
</ul>
For backwards compatibility, the onrefresh function can be specified directly
by this argument. In both cases, the image handle is passed to the function:
<pre>
    # preferred method
    JS9.RefreshImage(blob, {onrefresh: xrefresh});
    # for backwards compatibility
    JS9.RefreshImage(blob, xrefresh);
    # both call this function
    function xrefresh(im){ ... };
</pre>
<p>
Advanced use: it is possible to load several images into an instance
of JS9 and then refresh any of them regardless of which image is
currently displayed.  To do this, you pass the display property in a
trailing object, with the id of the image to refresh. For example, if
foo1.fits and foo2.fits are loaded and foo2.fits is currently displayed:
<pre>
    # refresh foo2.fits using foo2.fits as the new image
    JS9.RefreshImage();
    # refresh foo2.fits using foo3.fits as the new image
    JS9.RefreshImage("foo3.fits");

    # refresh foo1.fits (even though its not currently displayed)
    # it will be currently displayed once this operation is complete
    JS9.RefreshImage({display:"foo1.fits"});
    # refresh foo1.fits using foo4.fits as the new image
    JS9.RefreshImage("foo4.fits", {display:"foo1.fits"});

    # warning: this refreshes foo2.fits using foo1.fits as the new image,
    # rather than refreshing foo1.fits!!
    JS9.RefreshImage("foo1.fits");
</pre>
<p>
The main difference between <b>JS9.RefreshImage()</b> and
<a href="#JS9.Load"><b>JS9.Load()</b></a>
is that the former updates the data in the currently displayed image,
while the latter adds a completely new image to the display.

<h5 id="JS9.DisplaySection">Extract and display a section of a FITS file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplaySection(opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>opts</b>: object containing section options or "full"
</ul>
This routine allows you to extract and display a section of FITS file.
If the first argument is the text string "full", the full image is
displayed (assuming there is sufficient memory available.)  Otherwise
the opts object contains properties specifying how to generate and
display the section:
<ul>
<li><b>xcen</b>: x center of the section in file (physical) coords
<li><b>ycen</b>: y center of the section in file (physical) coords
<li><b>xdim</b>: x dimension of section to extract before binning
<li><b>ydim</b>: y dimension of section to extract before binning
<li><b>bin</b>: floating bin factor or bin directive string
<li><b>binMode</b>: "a" to average binned pixels, "s" to sum binned pixels
<li><b>filter</b>: for tables, row/event filter to apply when extracting section
<li><b>columns</b>: alternate columns for binning a table (def: "X Y")
<li><b>cubecol</b>: table to cube conversion column (col[:min:max][:bitpix])
<li><b>separate</b>: display as a separate image (default is to refresh the current image)
<li><b>refresh</b>: display as a refreshed image in a different display (default is to refresh the current image)
<li><b>ondisplaysection</b>: function to perform after section is displayed
</ul>
<p>
Numeric bin values are floating point numbers. A negative bin value means
1 / abs(bin), i.e.  bin value of -4 means to bin at 0.25. The string-valued
bin directives are:
<ul>
<li><b>x[n]|X[n]|*[n]</b>: multiply the current bin by n (e.g., "x2")
<li><b>/[n]</b>: divide the current bin by n (e.g., "/2")
<li><b>in|In</b>: multiply the current bin by 2
<li><b>out|Out</b>: divide the current bin by 2
<li><b>[n]a</b>: bin by n, averaging the binned pixels
<li><b>[n]s</b>: bin by n, summing the binned pixels
</ul>
Note that the <b>JS9.globalOpts.binMode</b> property specifies the
default action for whether the binned pixels are summed together (if
the global binMode is "s") or averaged (if the global binMode is
"a".) This behavior can be overridden by the <b>binMode</b> option or by
last two bin directives listed above.

<p>
All properties are optional: if a property is not specified,
the routine will use
<del>
the center of the file, with dimensions and binning
specified by JS9.globalOpts.table and JS9.globalOpts.image objects.
</del>
the image's current settings. This allows you to set up the section once,
and then repeatedly change a property such as the center or filter,
without having to specify the other properties.

<p>
For example, if an image has dimensions 4096 x 4096, then specifying:
<ul>
<li> center: 1024, 1024
<li> dimensions: 1024, 1024
<li> bin: 2
</ul>
will bin the upper left 1024 x 1024 section of the image by 2 to
produce a 512 x 512 image. Subsequent calls to change the center
values will pan the image using the same bin factor and dimension.

<p>
Note that setting xcen,ycen to 0,0 will specify the file center. 

<p>
By default, the new section replaces the data in the currently displayed
image. You can display the section as a separate image in the current display
by supplying an <b>opts</b> object with the <b>separate</b> property
set to <b>true</b>.  For example:
<pre>
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... separate: true});
</pre>
will display the new section separately from the original file,
allowing blinking, image blending, etc. between the two "files".

<p>
You also can display the section as a separate image in a different display by
supplying a string value to the <b>opts.separate</b> property. The string value
takes two forms:
<ul>
<li><b>[display]</b>: display the image in the specified JS9 display, using the same image id
<li><b>[display]:[id]</b>: display the image in the specified JS9 display, using the specified image id
</ul>
For example:
<pre>
  # separate into a new display, same image id
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... separate: "myJS9"});
  # separate into a new display, and with a new image id
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... separate: "myJS9:newsection.fits"});
</pre>
Both of these commands will display the new section "myJS9" display.
The first will retain the original image id, while the second will
use "newsection.fits" as the image id.

Alternatively, you can display the section by refreshing the image in a
different display by supplying a string value to the <b>opts.refresh</b>
property. Again, the string value takes two forms:
<ul>
<li><b>[display]</b>: refresh the image in the specified JS9 display,
using the same image id
<li><b>[display]:[id]</b>: refresh the image in the specified JS9
display, using the specified image id
</ul>
For example:
<pre>
  # refresh image in a new display, same image id
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... refresh: "myJS9"});
  # refresh the new display, and change to a new image id
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... refresh: "myJS9:newsection.fits"});
</pre>
If no image is currently loaded in the specified display, the first call
to this routine using the <b>refresh</b> property will create a new
image in that display.  Subsequent calls will refresh that image.

<p>
Table filtering allows you  to select rows from an FITS binary table
(e.g., an X-ray event list) by checking each row against an expression
involving the columns in the table. When a table is filtered, only
valid rows satisfying these expressions are used to make the image.

<p>
A filter expression consists of an arithmetic or logical operation
involving one or more column values from a table. Columns can be
compared to other columns or to numeric constants. Standard JavaScript
math functions can be applied to columns. JavaScript (or C) semantics
are used when constructing expressions, with the usual precedence and
associativity rules holding sway:
<pre>
  Operator                                Associativity
  --------                                -------------
  ()                                      left to right
  !  (bitwise not) - (unary minus)        right to left
  *  /                                    left to right
  +  -                                    left to right
  &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=                               left to right
  == !=                                   left to right
  &  (bitwise and)                        left to right
  ^  (bitwise exclusive or)               left to right
  |  (bitwise inclusive or)               left to right
  && (logical and)                        left to right
  || (logical or)                         left to right
  =                                       right to left
</pre>
For example, if energy and pha are columns in a table, then the
following are valid expressions:
<pre>
  pha &gt; 1
  energy == pha
  pha &gt; 1 && energy &le; 2
  max(pha,energy) &ge; 2.5
</pre>

<p>
NB: JS9 uses cfitsio by default (you can, but should not, use the
deprecated fitsy.js), and therefore follows cfitsio filtering
conventions, which are documented
<a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/c/c_user/node97.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
By default, tables are binned into an image using the "X" and "Y" columns. You
can specify different binning columns using the <b>opts.columns</b> property:
<pre>
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... columns: "DX DY"});
</pre>

<p>
Tables can be converted into 3D cubes by specifying the <b>opts.cubecol</b>
property. The cubecol value should be a string containing the column name and,
optionally, the min and max values and/or the bin size:
<pre>
  # each image in the cube has an width of 100 energy units
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... cubecol: "energy:100"});
  # image cube 3rd dimension is 60 ... each image having a bin width of 100
  JS9.DisplaySection({ ... cubecol: "energy:1000:7000:100"});
</pre>
By default, when <b>opts.cubecol</b> is specified, the <b>opts.separate</b>
property is set to true, i.e. a separate image is displayed, leaving the
original intact.
<p>
Obviously, cube generation will require a considerable amount of
memory since the resulting file is maintained in
the <a href="https://emscripten.org/" target="_blank">Emscripten</a>
heap. Because browser memory generally is limited, JS9 enforces a
memory limit on the size of the cube, specified by JS9.globalOpts.maxMemory
(and currently set to 2Gb). To avoid exceeding this limit, you usually try
adjusting the xdim, ydim, and/or bitpix values as well as the binsize of the
specified cube column:
<pre>
  # each image utilizes approx 2Mb, so that 400 slices should fit ...
  JS9.DisplaySection({xdim:1024, ydim:1024, bitpix:16, cubecol:"energy:1000:7000:20"});
</pre>

<p>
Once a cube has been created, you can use the <b>Cube</b> plugin to blink each
image slice. You can also run external analysis on individual slices.

<h5 id="JS9.DisplayExtension">Display an extension from a multi-extension FITS file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplayExtension(extid, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>extid</b>: HDU extension number or the HDU's EXTNAME string or "all"
<li><b>opts</b>: object containing options
</ul>
This routine allows you to display images and binary tables from
a multi-extension FITS file. The first argument is the 0-indexed HDU
number or the EXTNAME name value of the HDU extension to display. If "all"
is specified, then all 2D image extensions are loaded in order and displayed
as  separate images.
<p>
The optional opts object can contain:
<ul>
<li><b>separate</b>: boolean determining whether images are loaded separately
</ul>
If <b>separate</b> is true, the new extension is displayed as a separate image.
Otherwise, the new extension replaces the current display.
<p>
See <a href=" http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_primer.html">the FITS
Primer</a> for more information about HDUs and multi-extension FITS.

<h5 id="JS9.DisplaySlice">Display a slice of a FITS data cube</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplaySlice(slice, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>slice</b>: slice description, slice number, or "all"
<li><b>opts</b>: object containing options
</ul>
This routine allows you to display a 2D slice of a 3D or 4D FITS data
cube, i.e.,  a FITS image containing 3 or 4 axes.

<p>
The <b>slice</b> parameter can either be the numeric value of the
slice in the third (or fourth) image dimension (starting
with <b>1</b>) or it can be a slice description string: a combination
of asterisks (or commas) and a numeric value defines the slice
axis. Thus, for example, in a 1024 x 1024 x 16 cube, you can display
the sixth slice along the third axis in one of two ways:
<pre>
  JS9.DisplaySlice(6);
</pre>
or:
<pre>
  # sixth slice along third axis
  JS9.DisplaySlice("*:*:6");
  # comma separators also can be used
  JS9.DisplaySlice("*,*,6");
</pre>
If the image was organized as 16 x 1024 x 1024, you would use the
string description:
<pre>
  JS9.DisplaySlice("6:*:*");
</pre>
<p>
By default, the new slice replaces the data in the currently displayed
image. You can display the slice as a separate image in the current display
by supplying an <b>opts</b> object with the <b>separate</b> property
set to <b>true</b>.  For example:
<pre>
  JS9.DisplaySlice("6:*:*", {separate: true});
</pre>
will display the sixth slice of the first image dimension separately
from the original file, allowing blinking, image blending, etc. between
the two "files".  Note that the new id and filename are adjusted to be
the original file's values with the cfitsio image section <b>[6:6:*:*]</b>
appended.
<p>
If the first argument is "all", then all slices will be loaded into JS9 separately.

<h5 id="JS9.BlendImage">Blend the image in an image stack using W3C composite/blend modes</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.BlendImage(blendMode, opacity)</code>
<p>
Calling sequences:
<pre>
    JS9.BlendImage()                   # return current blend params
    JS9.BlendImage(true||false)        # turn on/off blending
    JS9.BlendImage(mode, opacity)      # set blend mode and/or opacity
</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>mode</b>: one of the W3C bend modes
<li><b>opacity</b>: the opacity of the blended image (percent from 0 to 1)
</ul>
Image processing programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Gimp allow you to blend
a stack of images together by mixing the RGB colors. The W3C has defined a
number of composite and blending modes which have been implemented by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari (what about Edge?):
<ul>
<li>normal
<li>multiply
<li>screen
<li>overlay
<li>darken
<li>lighten
<li>color-dodge
<li>color-burn
<li>hard-light
<li>soft-light
<li>difference
<li>exclusion
<li>hue
<li>saturation
<li>color
<li>luminosity
</ul>
In addition, the following Porter-Duff compositing modes are available
(though its unclear how useful they are in JS9 image processing):
<ul>
<li>clear
<li>copy
<li>source-over
<li>destination-over
<li>source-in
<li>destination-in
<li>source-out
<li>destination-out
<li>source-atop
<li>destination-atop
<li>xor
<li>lighter
</ul>
Blending and compositing modes are described in detail in this <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/" target="_blank">W3C candidate recommendation</a>
and in this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing" target="_blank">Mozilla document</a>.

<p>
JS9 allows you to use these modes to blend images together. If you load two
images of the same object into JS9, you can use the
<a href="#JS9.ReprojectData"><b>JS9.ReprojectData()</b></a>
routine to align them by WCS. You then can blend one image into the other by
specifying a blend mode and an optional opacity. For example, if chandra.fits
and spitzer.fits are two aligned images of the same object, and chandra.fits is
currently being displayed, you can blend spitzer into chandra using
the "screen" blend and opacity 0.9 mode this way:
<pre>
    JS9.BlendImage("screen", 0.9);
</pre>
After the spitzer image is blended, both images will be displayed as
part of the chandra.fits display. However, changing the colormap,
scale, contrast, or bias will only affect the current chandra image,
not the blended spitzer part.  In this way, you can continue to
manipulate the current image and the image blending will update automatically.

<p>
Also note that the spitzer image is still available separately for
display and manipulation. You can switch to displaying spitzer and
change colormap, scale, bias, contrast, etc. But since the images are
now blended, changes to spitzer will be reflected in the spitzer part
of the blended chandra display. Thus, if you change the colormap on
the display of spitzer, and change back to chandra, the blended
chandra image will utilize the new colormap.

<p>
This linkage is maintained during zoom and pan operations. If you
display the blended chandra image and then zoom or pan it, both images
will be updated correctly to maintain alignment. But note that this
means when you go back to the spitzer display, its zoom and/or pan
values will have been updated. In this way, the spitzer image always
is correctly linked to the blended version.

The <b>JS9.BlendImage()</b> call accepts a variable number of
arguments to perform a variety of functions:
<ul>
<li>JS9.BlendImage() returns an object containing the following properties:
<ul>
<li>active: boolean specifying whether this image is to be blended
<li>mode: string specifying the blend mode
<li>opacity: opacity value (0 to 1)
</ul>
<li>JS9.BlendImage() returns a blend object for the current image
<li>JS9.BlendImage(true||false) turns on/off blending of
<li>JS9.BlendImage(blend, opacity) set or modify the blend mode and/or opacity
</ul>
Other actions will be added as we gain experience with blending operations

<h5 id="JS9.BlendDisplay">Set the global image blend more for the specified display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">mode = JS9.BlendDisplay(true|false)</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>mode</b>: current blend mode
</ul>
This routine will turn on/off the global image blend mode for the specified
display. If no argument is specified, it returns the current blend mode.
<p>
If the first argument is "reset", the blend mode for all images in
this display will be set to false, along with the display's blend
mode. This is useful if you have loaded/blended a number of images, and
want to load/blend another set of images.
<p>
If the first argument is "list", an array is returned containing the image
id's of all images that have blend mode turned on for this display. This is
useful for changing the blend modes of all active images at once.

<h5 id="JS9.SyncImages">Synchronize operations between two or more images</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SyncImages(ops, images, opts)</code>
<p>
Calling sequences:
<pre>
    JS9.SyncImages([ops], [images], [opts])  # set up synchronization
    JS9.SyncImages(true||false)              # turn on/off synchronization
</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>ops</b>: operation or array of operations on which to sync
<li><b>images</b>: image or array of images to sync with this image
<li><b>opts</b>: options for sync'ing
</ul>
Synchronize two or more images, so that when an operation is performed
on one image, it also is performed on the other(s). For example, when
the colormap or scale is changed on an image, it also is changed on
the sync'ed images. Or, when a region is created, moved, resized, or
removed on an image, the same happens on the sync'ed images.

<p>
When the JS9.SyncImages() call is invoked, the current image is
configured to synchronize the specified images.  In addition, if
the <b>reciprocate</b> property is set in the opts object (see below),
the other images are also configured to synchronize one another (as
well as the current image.) Once configuration is complete, a sync
command is executed immediately. If the current image already
displays one or more regions, these will be created in the target images.

<p>
The operations that can be specified for sync'ing are: "alignment",
"colormap", "contrastbias" (i.e., both "contrast" and "bias"), "flip",
"pan", "regions", "rot90", "rotate", "scale", "wcs" (i.e., both
"wcssys" and "wcsunits"), and "zoom".  If no array is specified, the
default array in JS9.globalOpts.syncOps is used.

<p>
Regions calls the
<a href="#JS9.CopyRegions"><b>JS9.CopyRegions()</b></a> routine.
Alignment calls
<a href="#JS9.AlignPanZoom"><b>JS9.AlignPanZoom()</b></a> in order to
keep the pixel size and displayed center position constant between the
sync'ed images. It assumes no rotation between the two images.

<p>
Images to synchronize can be specified singly or as an array of image
handles or image ids. If no array is specified, all currently
displayed images are sync'ed.

<p>
The optional opts object can contain:
<ul>
<li><b>reverse</b>: boolean to reverse this image and target images (def: false)
<li><b>reciprocate</b>: boolean determining whether images sync one another
<li><b>syncwcs</b>: use WCS header params to sync (e.g., pan), where available

</ul>
If the opts object is not specified, the default values of
<b>reciprocate</b> and <b>syncwcs</b> are the values of the
JS9.globalOpts.syncReciprocate and JS9.globalOpts.syncWCS,
respectively.

<p>
Examples:
<pre>
    # the current image will sync all operations for all images
    # this will happen reciprocally, so that changing any image syncs the others
    JS9.SyncImages()

    # the current image will sync the specified ops for foo1.fits, foo2.fits:
    JS9.SyncImages(["scale", "colormap"], ["foo1.fits", "foo2.fits"])

    # the current image will sync two images with default ops,
    # but the two images themselves will not sync images reciprocally
    JS9.SyncImages(null, ["foo1.fits", "foo2.fits"], {reciprocate: false});
</pre>

<p>
Note that if the pan operation syncs two images having differently
sized fields of view, the smaller image will stop panning when it
reaches its edge, rather than displaying a blank field.

<p>
You can turn on/off syncing for a given image by specifying a single boolean
argument:
<pre>
    # turn off sync'ing temporarily
    JS9.SyncImages(false);
</pre>
This is different from unsync'ing in that you can turn sync'ing back on without
having to re-sync the images.

<h5 id="JS9.UnsyncImages">Unsynchronize two or more previously synchronized images</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.UnsyncImages(ops, images, opts)</code>
<p>
Calling sequence:
<pre>
    JS9.UnsyncImages([ops], [images], [opts])  # clear synchronization
</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>ops</b>: array of operations to unsync
<li><b>images</b>: array of images to unsync with this image
<li><b>opts</b>: options for unsync'ing
</ul>
Unsynchronize previously sync'ed images.

<p>
The operations that can be specified for unsync'ing are:
"alignment", "colormap", "contrastbias" (i.e., both "contrast" and "bias"),
"flip", "pan", "regions", "rot90", "rotate", "scale", "wcs" (i.e., both "wcssys" and
"wcsunits"), and "zoom".
If no array is specified, the default array in JS9.globalOpts.syncOps is
used. Thus, you can turn off sync'ing for specified operations, while leaving
others to be sync'ed.

<p>
Images to be unsync'ed can be specified as an array of image handles or
image ids. If no array is specified, all currently displayed images
are unsync'ed.

<p>
The optional opts object can contain:
<ul>
<li><b>reciprocate</b>: boolean determining whether images sync one another
<li><b>reverse</b>: boolean to reverse this image and target images (def: false)
</ul>
If the opts object is not specified, the default is to <b>reciprocate</b> based
on the value of the JS9.globalOpts.syncReciprocate property.

<p>
Examples:
<pre>
    # this image will no longer sync on scale for foo1.fits and foo2.fits,
    # and they also will stop sync'ing
    JS9.UnsyncImages(["scale"], ["foo1.fits", "foo2.fits"])

    # this image will still sync foo1.fits and foo2.fits, but
    # foo1.fits and foo2.fits will no longer sync this image:
    JS9.UnsyncImages(null, ["foo1.fits", "foo2.fits"], {reverse: true, reciprocal: false})
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.MaskImage">Mask an image using values in another image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.MaskImage(image, opts)</code>
<p>
Calling sequences:
<pre>
    JS9.MaskImage()                   # return current mask params
    JS9.MaskImage(true||false)        # turn on/off masking
    JS9.MaskImage(image, opts)        # set mask and optionally, its params
    JS9.MaskImage(opts)               # set mask params
</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>image</b>: image handle or image id to use as a mask
<li><b>opts</b>: optional mask properties
</ul>
and where the mask properties are:
<ul>
<li><b>mode</b>: "mask", "opacity", or "overlay"
<li><b>value</b>: mask value that triggers masking (def: 0) for "mask" mode
<li><b>invert</b>: whether to invert the mask (def: false) for "mask" mode
<li><b>sync</b>: true or false for "overlay" mode
<li><b>opacity</b>: opacity to use when masking (def: 0, range 0 to 1)
for "mask" and "overlay" mode
</ul>
<p>
The pixel values in one image can be used to mask the pixels in
another image <b>if the two images have the same image dimensions</b>.
The type of masking depends on the mode: "overlay" (default) or "mask".
<p>
For "mask" mode, if the value of a pixel in the mask is less than or
equal to the <b>value</b> property, the opacity of the displayed pixel
is set to the <b>opacity</b> property. You can also invert the mask
using the <b>invert</b> property. In effect, this mode displays only
the image pixels "covered" by a mask.
<p>
For "opacity" mode, each image pixel is assigned an opacity equal to the
value of the mask pixel (whose values are assumed to range from 0 to 1.)
<p>
For "overlay" mode, if the mask pixel has a non-zero alpha, its color
is blended with the image pixel using <b>source-atop</b>
composition. Otherwise, the image pixel color alone is used in the
display. This is one way you can display a mask overlay on top of an
image.  A static colormap is usually used in conjunction with an
overlay mask, since pixel values not explicitly assigned a color are
transparent.  Note that, when blending a mask and image pixel, the
global mask opacity and the individual pixel opacity are multiplied to
get the final pixel opacity. If "sync" is not explicitly false, this
mode will call <a href="#JS9.SyncImages"><b>JS9.SyncImages()</b></a>
to keep the mask and image file in sync. The maskOpts property <b>sync</b>
contains the array of operations to sync.
<p>
To set up a mask initially, call the routine with an already-loaded
mask image as the first parameter, and an optional opts object as the
second parameter:
<pre>
    # default is "overlay"
    JS9.ImageMask("casa_mask.fits");
    JS9.ImageMask("casa_mask.fits", {mode: "overlay"});

    # "mask" mode: set lower threshold for masking and masked opacity
    JS9.ImageMask("casa_mask.fits", {mode: "mask", value: 5, opacity: 0.2});
</pre>
You can change the mask parameters at any time:
<pre>
    JS9.ImageMask({value: 2, opacity: 0});
</pre>
or temporarily turn off and on the mask:
<pre>
    JS9.ImageMask(false);
    ...
    JS9.ImageMask(true);
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.CloseImage">Clear the image from the display and mark resources for release</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CloseImage(opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object or JSON string containing image parameters
</ul>
<p>
<p>
Each loaded image claims a non-trivial amount of memory from a finite
amount of browser heap space. For example, the default 32-bit version
of Google Chrome has a memory limit of approximately 500Mb. If you are
finished viewing an image, closing it tells the browser that the
image's memory can be freed. In principle, this is can help reduce
overall memory usage as successive images are loaded and
discarded. Note, however, that closing an image only provides a hint
to the browser, since this sort of garbage collection is not directly
accessible to JavaScript programming and happens when it happens.
<p>
The optional first argument is an opts object (or a JSON-formatted
string) containing:
<ul>
<li><b>clear</b>: if explicitly set to false, the image will not be cleared
</ul>
The <b>clear</b> option is useful if you are repeatedly loading the same image
and want to avoid the image blink associated with the clear.

<h5 id="JS9.GetColormap">Get the image colormap</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">cmap = JS9.GetColormap()</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>cmap</b>: object containing colormap information
</ul>
The returned cmap object will contain the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>colormap</b>: colormap name
<li><b>contrast</b>: contrast value (range: 0 to 10)
<li><b>bias</b>: bias value (range 0 to 1)
</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.SetColormap">Set the image colormap</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SetColormap(colormap, [contrast, bias])</code>
Calling sequences:
<pre>
    JS9.SetColormap(colormap)
    JS9.SetColormap(colormap, contrast, bias)
    JS9.SetColormap(colormap, staticOpts)
    JS9.SetColormap(contrast, bias)
    JS9.SetColormap(staticOpts)
</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>colormap</b>: colormap name
<li><b>contrast</b>: contrast value (range: 0 to 10)
<li><b>bias</b>: bias value (range 0 to 1)
<li><b>staticOpts</b>: static colormap opts
</ul>
Set the current colormap, contrast/bias, or both. This call takes one
(colormap), two (contrast, bias) or three (colormap, contrast, bias)
arguments. It also takes the following single arguments:
<ul>
<li><b>rgb</b>: toggle RGB mode
<li><b>invert</b>: toggle inversion of the colormap
<li><b>overlay</b>: toggle image overlay mode (PNG and JPEG files only)
<li><b>reset</b>: reset contrast, bias, and invert values
<li><b>staticOpts</b>: opts for a static colormap
</ul>
The <b>staticOpts</b> argument is an array of parameters to change in a static
colormap. Each parameter can take one of two forms:
<ul>
<li>[color, min, max]
<li>[color, opacity|alpha]
<li>[color, true|false]
</ul>
The <b>color</b> parameter must match one of the colors specified when the
static colormap was created. The <b>min</b> and <b>max</b> properties replace
the originally specified min and max values. Specifying a number between 0
and 1 (inclusive) will change the opacity, while specifying a number greater
than 1 will change the alpha (i.e., opacity * 255.) Specifying <b>true</b> or
<b>false</b> will set or unset the <b>active</b> flag for that color, i.e.
it will turn on or off use of that color. When turned off, the pixels in that
range will be transparent. For example:
<pre>
  SetColormap([["red", 0.5], ["green", true], ["blue", false]]);
</pre>
sets the opacity of red pixels to 0.5, turns on the green pixels, and turns
off the blue pixels in the currently active static colormap.
<p>
Finally, note that PNG and JPEG images have a "private" colormap
associated with them, which is an approximation of the original colors
used in these images.  You can set this colormap by specifying
"private":
<pre>
  SetColormap("private");
</pre>
This private colormap is static: you cannot change contrast and
bias. It also cannot be modified using <b>staticOpts</b> because there is
no <b>color</b> string value associated with each entry in the colormap.

<h5 id="JS9.SaveColormap">Save colormap(s)</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SaveColormap(fname, cmapArray)</code>

Calling sequences:
<pre>
    JS9.SaveColormap()                 # save current colormap to "js9.cmap"
    JS9.SaveColormap(fname)            # save current colormap to fname

</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>fname</b>: output file name
<li><b>cmapArray</b>: optional array of colormap names to save
</ul>
As shown by the calling sequences above, you can use this routine to
save either the current colormap or a list of colormaps taken from the
specified array. You also can choose to save to a particular filename
or the default "js9.cmap":
<pre>
  # save the current colormap in js9.cmap
  JS9.SaveColormap()
  # save the current colormap in foo.cmap
  JS9.SaveColormap("foo.cmap")
  # save the foo1 and foo2 colormaps in js9.cmap
  JS9.SaveColormap(["foo1", "foo2"])
  # save the user-defined foo1 and foo2 colormaps in foo.cmap
  JS9.SaveColormap("foo.cmap", ["foo1", "foo2"])
</pre>
<p>
The colormaps are saved in JSON format. Multiple saved colormaps will
be stored in a JSON array, while a single saved colormap will be saved
at the top level.
<p>
Don't forget that the file is saved by the browser, in whatever location
you have set up for downloads.
</p>

<h5 id="JS9.AddColormap">Add a colormap to JS9</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.AddColormap(name, aa|rr,gg,bb|ss|obj|json, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b>: colormap name
<li><b>aa</b>: an array containing RGB color triplets
<li><b>rr,gg,bb</b>: 3 arrays of vertices specifying color changes
<li><b>ss</b>: an array static color assignments
<li><b>obj</b>: object containing one of the three colormap definition formats
<li><b>json</b>: JSON string containing one of the colormap definition formats
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object to set toplevel property to false
</ul>
You can add new colormaps to JS9 using one of three formats. The first
is an array of RGB triplets (i.e., an array of 3-D arrays), where each
triplet defines a color. The elements of the colormap are divided
evenly between these 3-D triplets.  For example, the <b>i8</b>
colormap is defined as:
<pre>
    JS9.AddColormap("i8", [[0,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1], [1,0,0], [1,1,0], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]]));
</pre>
Here, the colormap is divided into 8 sections having the following
colors: black, green, blue, cyan (green + blue), red, yellow (red +
green), purple (red + blue), and white. A colormap such as <b>sls</b>
also utilizes an array of RGB triplets, but it has 200 entries,
leading to much more gradual transitions between colors.
<p>
The second colormap format consists three arrays of vertices defining
the change in intensity of red, green, and blue, respectively. For
each of these three color triplets, the first coordinate of each
vertex is the x-distance along the colormap axis (scaled from 0 to 1)
and the second coordinate is the y-intensity of the color.  Colors are
interpolated between the vertices.  For example, consider the following:
<pre>
    JS9.AddColormap("red", [[0,0],[1,1]], [[0,0], [0,0]], [[0,0],[0,0]]);
    JS9.AddColormap("blue", [[0,0],[0,0]], [[0,0], [0,0]], [[0,0],[1,1]]);
    JS9.AddColormap("purple", [[0,0],[1,1]], [[0,0], [0,0]], [[0,0],[1,1]]);
</pre>
In the red (blue) colormap, the red (blue) array contains two
vertices, whose color ranges from no intensity (0) to full intensity
(1) over the whole range of the colormap (0 to 1.) The same holds true
for the purple colormap, except that both red and blue change from zero
to full intensity.
<p>
The third colormap format consists of an array of color and pixel range
specifications: color, min, max. This defines a static colormap in which
colors are assigned based on whether an image pixel is within a range.
For example:
<pre>
  JS9.AddColormap("mask",
                  [["#ff000080", 1, 31],
		   ["cyan", 32, 32],
		   ["rgba(0,255,0,0.5)", 37, 99],
		   ["blue", 100, Infinity]]);
</pre>
Image pixel values between 1 and 31 (inclusive) are assigned a
red color (#ff0000) with an opacity of approximately 0.5. The image
pixel value 32 is assigned the color cyan. Image pixel values between
37 and 99 are assigned the color green with opacity 0.5. All image
pixel values greater than or equal to 100 are blue. (You can also specify
the string "Infinity".) If an image pixel value is not within any
range, it is assigned the color specified
by <b>JS9.imageOpts.nocolor</b>. By default, this is black with an
opacity of 0, so nothing is displayed at all (you'll probably see the
default grey background of the JS9 display element.) Static colormaps
are mostly used as image masks. See
<a href="#JS9.MaskImage"><b>JS9.MaskImage()</b></a> for more information.

<p>
Note the different ways in which colors can be specified: more information
about accepted color formats is available on the
<a href="https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor" target="_blank">TinyColor</a>
website.


<p>
For a more complicated example, consider the <b>a</b> colormap, which is
defined as:
<pre>
    JS9.AddColormap("a",
      [[0,0], [0.25,0], [0.5,1], [1,1]],
      [[0,0], [0.25,1], [0.5,0], [0.77,0], [1,1]],
      [[0,0], [0.125,0], [0.5, 1], [0.64,0.5], [0.77, 0], [1,0]]);
</pre>
Here we see that red is absent for the first quarter of the colormap,
then gradually increases to full intensity by the half mark, after
which it stays at full intensity to the end. Green ramps up to full
intensity in the first quarter, then drops to zero by the half and
stays that way until a bit more than three-quarters along, after which
it gradually increases again. Blue starts off at no intensity for an
eighth, then gradually increases to full intensity by the half-way
mark, decreasing gradually to zero by the three-quarter mark. The
result is that you see, for example, green at the beginning and yellow
(red + green) at the end, with some purple (red + blue) in the middle
of the colormap.
<p>
As a convenience, you also can pass an object or JSON string containing the
colormap definition:
<pre>
    # RGB color triplets for the I8 colormap in a "colors" property
    {"name":"i8","colors":[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]}

    # all 3 vertex arrays for the purple colormap in one "vertices" property
    {"name":"purple","vertices":[[[0,0],[1,1]],[[0,0],[0,0]],[[0,0],[1,1]]]}
</pre>
<p>
The colormap will be added to the toplevel of the <b>Colormap</b>
menu, unless you pass a final opts argument that sets
the <b>toplevel</b> property to false:
<pre>
  JS9.AddColormap("cyan", [[0,0],[0,0]], [[0,0],[1,1]], [[0,0],[1,1]], {toplevel:false});
</pre>
Finally, note that <b>JS9.AddColormap()</b> adds its new colormap to
all JS9 displays on the given page.

<li><b>mode</b>: boolean true to activate RGB mode, false to disable
<li><b>imobj</b>: optional object specifying three images to set to the
"red", "green", and "blue" colormaps
</ul>
In RGB mode, three images assigned the "red", "green", and "blue"
colormaps are displayed as a single image. The RGB color of each
displayed pixel is a combination of the "red", "green", and "blue"
pixel value taken from the appropriate image. Note that all three
images are not required: you can display an RGB image using two of
the three colors simply by not assigning the third colormap.

<p>
The <b>JS9.SetRGBMode()</b> call turns on or off RGB mode. The
boolean <b>mode</b> argument specifies whether to activate or
de-activate RGB mode. The optional <b>imobj</b> object specifies
(already-loaded) images to assign to the three colormaps:
<ul>
<li><b>rid</b>: image id (or handle) to set to the "red" colormap
<li><b>gid</b>: image id (or handle) to set to the "green" colormap
<li><b>bid</b>: image id (or handle) to set to the "blue" colormap
</ul>
If <b>imobj</b> is not specified, it is assumed that images have been
assigned the "red", "green", and "blue" colormaps by another means.
(Once again, it is not necessary to assign all three colormaps.)
<p>
If no arguments are specified, the current RGB mode is toggled;

<li><b>floorvalue</b>: floor value to test image pixel values against
<li><b>flooropacity</b>: floor opacity value to set if image pixel value is less than or equal to the floor opacity value
</ul>
Set the current opacity, floor opacity, or both. This call takes one
(opacity), two (floorvalue, flooropacity) or three (opacity, floorvalue, flooropacity) arguments.
<p>
The <b>floor value & opacity</b> option allows you to set the opacity
for pixels whose image value is less then or equal to a specified
floor value. It takes two arguments: the floor pixel value to check,
and the floor opacity to apply. For example, when both arguments are 0,
pixels whose image values are less than or equal to 0
will be transparent. Specifying 5 and 0.5, respectively, means that
pixels whose image values less than or equal to 5 will have an opacity
of 0.5. A useful case is to make the pixels transparent at a
given value, allowing features of one image to be blended into
another, without blending extraneous pixels.
<p>
The various <b>reset</b> options allow you to reset the default value,
floor values, or both.

<li><b>y</b>: calculated (from section) y image coordinate of center
<li><b>ox</b>: original (input) x image coordinate of center
<li><b>oy</b>: original (input) y image coordinate of center
<li><b>x0</b>: x start of image section
<li><b>y0</b>: y start of image section
<li><b>x1</b>: x end of image section
<li><b>y1</b>: y end of image section
<li><b>ix</b>: x offset of center from center of display
<li><b>iy</b>: y offset of center from center of display
</ul>
Note that the x and y values are the center of the image section, which might
be different from the input x and y values passed
<a href="#JS9.SetPan">JS9.SetPan()</a>. The latter are returned as ox
and oy. The image section parameters are also returned. Finally, the
ix and iy values will be non-zero in cases of unconstrained,
off-centered panning.

<h5 id="JS9.SetPan">Set the image pan position</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SetPan(x, y)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>x</b>: x image coordinate (or an object containing a position)
<li><b>y</b>: y image coordinate
</ul>
<p>
Set the current pan position using image coordinates. Note that you can use
<a href="#JS9.WCSToPix"><b>JS9.WCSToPix()</b></a>
and
<a href="#JS9.PixToWCS"><b>JS9.PixToWCS()</b></a>
to convert between image and WCS coordinates.
</p>
An object can also be supplied with a position specified in image,
physical, or WCS coordinates:
<ul>
<li><b>x</b>: image x position
<li><b>y</b>: image y position
<li><b>px</b>: physical x position
<li><b>py</b>: physical y position
<li><b>ra</b>: RA in degrees
<li><b>dec</b>: Dec in degrees
<li><b>wcs</b>: sexagesimal WCS string with optional WCS system
</ul>
For example:
<pre>
    JS9.SetPan({wcs: "23:23:28.895 +58:49:43.50 ICRS"});
</pre>
will set the pan position to the specified RA and Dec using the ICRS
system. Note that the WCS string above is returned by the <b>Edit</b>
menu's "copy wcs pos" option (i.e., the "/" keystroke.)

<p>
Finally, if you pass the string "mouse" as the sole argument, the
image is panned to the current mouse position. This is especially useful
in conjunction with keyboard shortcuts (where currently the "m" key uses this
routine to pan to the current mouse position.)

<p>
By default, panning is unconstrained: you can pan the image so that
some (or even all) of the display does not contain image data (e.g.,
if you pan an image to point 0,0, the image origin will be the
center of the display and only the upper right quadrant will contain
data.) If you want to avoid blank areas in the display, set the
<b>JS9.globalOpts.panWithinDisplay</b> property to true.  Site authors
can change this property in <b>js9prefs.js</b>, while users can change
this via the <b>Global</b> tab of the <b>Preferences</b> plugin.

<h5 id="JS9.AlignPanZoom">Align pan and zoom of the current image to a target image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.AlignPanZoom(im, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>im</b>: target image containing the WCS used to perform the alignment
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object
</ul>
<p>
This routine changes the pan and zoom of the current image to match a
target image. By default, it is assumed that both have WCS info
available. The image is panned to the RA, Dec at the center of the
target image's display. The zoom is also matched. The pixel size (as
specified by the FITS CDELT1 parameter) will be taken into account
when zooming, but not the image rotation or flip. This routine is
faster than
<b><a href="#JS9.ReprojectData">JS9.ReprojectData()</a></b>
for aligning reasonably similar images.

<p>
For specialized needs, you can set the <b>syncwcs</b> property to false in
the opts object so that WCS will not be used in the alignment. Instead,
the image will be panned to the target's current center (in image coordinates)
and the image zoom will be set to the target's zoom. Obviously, this assumes
identical image dimensions and pixel sizes. It can be useful when working with
lab data and simulations.

<p>
No attempt is make to keep the images aligned after the call. This
allows you to make adjustments to the current and/or target images and
then re-align as needed.

<h5 id="JS9.SetFlip">Flip an image around the x or y axis</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SetFlip(flip)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>flip</b>: "x", "y"
</ul>
Flip an image around the specified axis. Flipping is relative to the
current state of the display, so flipping by x twice will return you
to the original orientation.
<p>
Since this operation is applied to the entire display canvas instead
of the image, image parameters such as the WCS are not affected.

<h5 id="JS9.GetFlip">Get flip state of an image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">flip = JS9.GetFlip()</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>flip</b>: the current flip state
</ul>
Possible returned flip states are: "x", "y", "xy", or "none".
The state is normalized, so that, for example, two "x" flips are
replaced by "none".

<h5 id="JS9.SetRotate">Rotate an image by a specified number of degrees</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SetRotate(rot)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>rot</b>:  rotation in degrees
</ul>
Set the rotation of an image to the specified number of degrees. The
rotation is performed in terms of an absolute angle: if you rotate by
20 degrees and then do it again, there is no change. Also, setting the
rotation to 0 sets the angle to 0.
<p>
In the rotation argument is the string "north" or "northisup", the
rotation angle is calculated so that north is up in the current
coordinate system.
<p>
Since this operation is applied to the entire display canvas instead
of the image, image parameters such as the WCS are not affected.

<h5 id="JS9.GetRotate">Get rotate state of an image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">rot = JS9.GetRotate()</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>rot</b>: current rotation value for this image
</ul>
Return the current rotation.

<h5 id="JS9.SetRot90">Rotate an image by +/- 90 degrees</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SetRot90(rot90)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>rot90</b>: a multiple of 90 degrees (+/-90)
</ul>
Rotate an image by a multiple of 90 degrees. Rot90 rotations are
relative to the current state of the display, so four rotations will
return you to the original orientation.
<p>
Since this operation is applied to the entire display canvas instead
of the image, image parameters such as the WCS are not affected.

<h5 id="JS9.GetRot90">Get rotate state of an image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">rot = JS9.GetRot90()</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>rot</b>: current rotation value for this image
</ul>
The returned rotation value will be a multiple of 90, depending on how
many rotations have been executed and in which direction.  

<h5 id="JS9.GetParam">Get an image parameter value</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">val = JS9.GetParam(param)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>param</b>: name of the parameter or "all"
</ul>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>val</b>: value of the parameter
</ul>

<p>
Return the value of an image parameter. The available parameters are listed
below in the
<a href="#JS9.SetParam"><b>JS9.SetParam()</b></a>
section.
</p>
In the value of param is "all", the entire param object is returned.

<h5 id="JS9.SetParam">Set an image parameter value</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">ovalue = JS9.SetParam(param, value)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>param</b>: name of the parameter or "all"
<li><b>val</b>: new value of the parameter or param object to merge
</ul>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>ovalue</b>: the previous value of the parameter or the new param object
</ul>
A number of miscellaneous image parameters are copied from the
JS9.imageOpts object to each image when it is first loaded. You can
use the <b>JS9.SetParam()</b> routine to modify these values
subsequently. The available parameters and their current default
values are listed below:
<ul>
<li><b>exp</b>: 1000, default exp value for scaling
<li><b>disable</b>: which core services to disable for this image
<li><b>listonchange</b>: false, list regions after a region change?
<li><b>opacity</b>: 1.0, image display opacity, between 0 and 1
<li><b>overlay</b>: whether PNG/JPEG display the image instead of using cmaps
<li><b>nancolor</b>: "#000000", 6-digit #hex color for NaN values
<li><b>valpos</b>: true, display value/position?
<li><b>wcsalign</b>: true, align image using WCS after reproj?
<li><b>xeqonchange</b>: true, xeq an onchange callback after a region change?
<li><b>zscalecontrast</b>: 0.25, default zscale value from ds9
<li><b>zscalesamples</b>: 600,	default zscale value from ds9
<li><b>zscaleline</b>: 120, default zscale value from ds9
</ul>
<p>
In addition, you can set the internal values associated with core functionality
("colormap", "pan", "regions", "scale", "wcs", or "zoom") and the
corresponding core function will be called. The core parameters that can be
set in this way are:
<ul>
<li><b>colormap</b>: calls JS9.SetColormap()
<li><b>contrast</b>: calls JS9.SetColormap()
<li><b>bias</b>: calls JS9.SetColormap()
<li><b>flip</b>: calls JS9.SetFlip()
<li><b>rot90</b>: calls JS9.SetRot90()
<li><b>rot</b>: calls JS9.SetRotate()
<li><b>scale</b>: calls JS9.SetScale()
<li><b>scalemin</b>: calls JS9.SetScale()
<li><b>scalemax</b>: calls JS9.SetScale()
<li><b>scaleclipping</b>: calls JS9.SetScale()
<li><b>wcssys</b>: calls JS9.SetWCSSys()
<li><b>wcsunits</b>: calls JS9.SetWCSUnits()
<li><b>zoom</b>: calls JS9.SetZoom()
</ul>
<p>
The routine returns the previous value of the parameter, which can
be useful when temporarily turning off a function. For example:
<pre>
    oval = JS9.SetParam("xeqonchange", false);
    .... processing ...
    JS9.SetParam("xeqonchange", oval);
</pre>
will temporarily disable execution of the previously defined regions
onload callback, resetting it to the old value after processing
is complete.
<p>
If param is "all" and the second argument is an object, this object is
merged into the current param object. This allows you to save the params from
one image and restore them to another. If the object contains internal
core parameters (see above), the corresponding core function will be called.
<p>
If param is "disable", the specified value (or array of values) is
added to the <b>disable</b> array for this image, thereby disabling
core functionality. The resulting <b>disable array</b> is
returned. Thus, for example:
<pre>
    JS9.SetParam("disable", ["zoom", "pan"]);
</pre>
will disable zoom and pan functionality for this image. Note that
disabling regions means that you cannot create new regions,
but you can still change and even remove existing regions.
<p>
If param is "enable", the specified value (or array of values) is
removed to the <b>disable</b> array for this image, thereby enabling core
functionality. The resulting <b>disable array</b> is returned.

<h5 id="JS9.CopyParams">Copy image parameter(s) to one or more images</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CopyParams(param, image, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>param</b>: name of the parameter or array or parameters to copy
<li><b>image</b>: target image or array of image to copy to
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object
</ul>
<p>
Copy parameters from the current image to one or more images.  Any
image parameter can be copied, but the most common ones are:
"alignment", "colormap", "contrastbias" (i.e., both "contrast" and
"bias"), "flip", "pan", "rot90", "rotate", "scale", "wcs" (i.e., both
"wcssys" and "wcsunits"), and "zoom". Note that copying a parameter
results in
<a href="#JS9.SetParam"><b>JS9.SetParam()</b></a> being called,
triggering the corresponding core function if necessary.  Thus, for
example, copying the colormap will change the colormap of the target
image. See <a href="#JS9.SetParam"><b>JS9.SetParam()</b></a> for more
details about setting parameters.

<p>
Regions calls the
<a href="#JS9.CopyRegions"><b>JS9.CopyRegions()</b></a> routine.
Alignment calls
<a href="#JS9.AlignPanZoom"><b>JS9.AlignPanZoom()</b></a> in order to
keep the pixel size and displayed center position constant between the
sync'ed images. It assumes no rotation between the two images.
Finally, you can also copy "shapes", which calls the
<a href="#JS9.CopyShapes"><b>JS9.CopyShapes()</b></a> routine.
In the latter case, you will need to pass the shape layer name in the
<b>layer</b> property of the opts argument.

<p>
The target image(s) to copy to can be specified singly or as an array
of image handles or image ids. If no images are specified, all images
are used as targets.

<h5 id="JS9.EventToDisplayPos">Get the display coordinates from an event</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">dpos = JS9.EventToDisplayPos(evt)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>evt</b>: a JavaScript or jQuery event
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>dpos</b>: display position object containing 0-indexed x and y display
coordinate values
</ul>
If you define your own event callbacks, you can use this routine to convert
the event position to a display position, which can then be used to get the
image position (see below.)

<h5 id="JS9.DIsplayToImagePos">Get the image coordinates from the display coordinates</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">ipos = JS9.DisplayToImagePos(dpos)</code>
<p>
where:

<li><b>dpos</b>: display position object containing 0-indexed x and y display
coordinate values
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>ipos</b>: image position object containing 1-indexed x and y image
coordinate values
</ul>
Note that image coordinates are one-indexed, as per FITS conventions, while
display coordinate are 0-indexed.

<h5 id="JS9.ImageToDisplayPos">Get the display coordinates from the image coordinates</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">dpos = JS9.ImageToDisplayPos(ipos)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>ipos</b>: image position object containing 1-indexed x and y image
coordinate values
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>dpos</b>: display position object containing 0-indexed x and y display
coordinate values
</ul>
Get display (screen) coordinates from image coordinates.  Note that
image coordinates are one-indexed, as per FITS conventions, while
display coordinate are 0-indexed.

<h5 id="JS9.LogicalToImagePos">Get the image coordinates from the logical coordinates</h5>

coordinate values
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>ipos</b>: image position object containing 1-indexed x and y image
coordinate values
</ul>
Logical coordinate systems include: "physical" (defined by LTM/LTV keywords in a
FITS header), "detector" (DTM/DTV keywords), and "amplifier" (ATM/ATV keywords.)
Physical coordinates are the most common. In the world of X-ray astronomy, they
refer to the "zoom 1" coordinates of the data file.

<p>
This routine will convert from logical to image coordinates. By default, the
current logical coordinate system is used. You can specify a different logical
coordinate system (assuming the appropriate keywords have been defined.)

<h5 id="JS9.ImageToLogicalPos">Get the logical coordinates from the image coordinates</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">lpos = JS9.ImageToLogicalPos(ipos, lcs)</code>
<p>
where:

coordinate values
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>lpos</b>: logical position object containing 1-indexed x and y logical
coordinate values
</ul>
Logical coordinate systems include: "physical" (defined by LTM/LTV keywords in a
FITS header), "detector" (DTM/DTV keywords), and "amplifier" (ATM/ATV keywords.)
Physical coordinates are the most common. In the world of X-ray astronomy, they
refer to the "zoom 1" coordinates of the data file.
<p>
This routine will convert from image to logical coordinates. By default, the
current logical coordinate system is used. You can specify a different logical
coordinate system (assuming the appropriate keywords have been defined.)

<h5 id="JS9.GetValPos">Get value/position information</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">valpos = JS9.GetValPos(ipos, display)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>ipos</b>: image position object containing 1-indexed x and y image coord values
<li><b>display</b>: boolean value specifying whether the info box display should be updated (default is true)
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>valpos</b>: value/position object
</ul>
This routine determines the data value at a given image position
and returns an object containing the following information:
<ul>

</ul>
Set the display mode of the value/position display for the specified image.

<h5 id="JS9.GetImageInherit">Get the image inherit mode</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">inherit = JS9.GetImageInherit()</code>
<p>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>inherit</b>: true if new image inherits params from current image
</ul>
The <b>JS9.GetImageInherit()</b> routine returns a boolean specifying whether
a new image grabs the image params (e.g., colormap, scale, zoom, etc.)
from the currently displayed image. If false, these params are taken
from the default JS9.imageOpts object.

<h5 id="JS9.SetImageInherit">Set the image inherit mode</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SetImageInherit(mode)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>mode</b>: true (inherit params from currently displayed image) or false
</ul>
The <b>JS9.SetImageInherit()</b> routine specifies whether
a new image grabs the image params (e.g., colormap, scale, zoom, etc.)
from the currently displayed image. If false, these params are taken
from the default JS9.imageOpts object.

<h5 id="JS9.GetWCS">Get information about the current WCS</h5>

<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>which</b>: WCS name or id
</ul>
Set the current WCS, in cases where alternate WCS's are available. The
alternate WCS convention is described in the standard paper by Greisen
and Callebretta <i>Representations of world coordinates in FITS</i>
(A&A 395, 1061–1075 (2002).) If a FITS file contains alternate WCS
info, you can switch to an alternate using this routine or using
the <b>File->alternate wcs</b> menu option.
<p>
The <b>which</b> argument can be one of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>default</b>: the default WCS from the original file

where:
<ul>
<li><b>sysstr</b>: World Coordinate System ("FK4", "FK5", "ICRS",
"galactic", "ecliptic", "image", or "physical")
</ul>
Set current WCS system. The WCS systems are available only if WCS
information is contained in the FITS header. Also note that "physical"
coordinates are the coordinates tied to the original file. They are
mainly used in X-ray astronomy where individually detected photon
events are binned into an image, possibly using a blocking factor.
For optical images, image and physical coordinate usually are identical.

<h5 id="JS9.PixToWCS">Convert image pixel position to WCS position</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">wcsobj = JS9.PixToWCS(x, y)</code>
<p>
where:

<li><b>dec</b>: declination in floating point degrees 
<li><b>sys</b>: current world coordinate system being used
<li><b>str</b>: string of WCS in current system ("[ra] [dec] [sys]")
</ul>
You can either supply the x and y image coordinates as two numeric
arguments, or supply a single object containing numeric x and y properties.

<h5 id="JS9.WCSToPix">Convert WCS position to image pixel position</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">pixobj = JS9.WCSToPix(ra, dec)</code>

The returned pixel object contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>x</b>: x image coordinate
<li><b>y</b>: y image coordinate
<li><b>str</b>: string of pixel values ("[x]" "[y]")
</ul>
You can either supply the RA and Dec as two numeric arguments, or supply a
single object containing numeric ra and dec properties.

<h5 id="JS9.DisplayMessage">Display a text message</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplayMessage(which, text)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>which</b>: "info" or "regions"
<li><b>text</b>: text to display
</ul>
The text string is displayed in the "info" area (usually occupied by the
valpos display) or the "region" area (where regions are displayed.) The
empty string will clear the previous message.

<h5 id="JS9.DisplayCoordGrid">Display a WCS-based coordinate grid</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplayCoordGrid(mode, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>mode</b>: true (display) or false (hide)
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object or JSON string containing grid parameters
</ul>
A coordinate grid displays lines of constant RA and constant Dec, with
the points of intersection labeled by their RA and Dec values. The
labels are in sexagesimal notation if the WCS units are sexagesimal,
otherwise they are in degrees. When using sexagesimal notation, labels
will be shortened if possible, e.g., if the RA hours are the same in
two successive labels but the minutes are different, only the minutes
are shown in the second label.

<p>
If no arguments are supplied, the routine returns true if the
coordinate grid is currently being displayed, false otherwise. A
boolean first argument specifies whether to display the coordinate
grid or not.

<p>
The optional second argument is an opts object (or a JSON-formatted
string) containing properties to override the default JS9.Grid.opts
properties. These properties include:
<ul>
<li><b>strokeWidth</b>: grid stroke width
<li><b>lineColor</b>: color of RA and Dec grid lines
<li><b>raLines</b>: approx. number of RA grid lines
<li><b>raAngle</b>: rotation for RA label
<li><b>raSkip</b>: number of RA lines to skip
<li><b>decLines</b>: approx. number of Dec grid lines
<li><b>decAngle</b>: rotation for Dec label
<li><b>decSkip</b>: number of Dec lines to skip
<li><b>labelColor</b>: color of text labels
<li><b>labelFontFamily</b>: label font
<li><b>labelFontSize</b>: label font size
<li><b>labelFontStyle</b>: label font style
<li><b>labelFontWeight</b>: label font weight
<li><b>labelRAOffx</b>: x offset of RA labels
<li><b>labelRAOffy</b>: y offset of RA labels
<li><b>labelDecOffx</b>: x offset of Dec labels
<li><b>labelDecOffy</b>: y offset of Dec labels
<li><b>degPrec</b>: precision for degree labels
<li><b>sexaPrec</b>: precision for sexagesimal labels
<li><b>reduceDims</b>: reduce lines of smaller image dim?
<li><b>stride</b>: fineness of grid lines
<li><b>margin</b>: edge margin for displaying a line
<li><b>labelMargin</b>: edge margin for displaying RA, Dec label
<li><b>cover</b>: grid lines cover: display or image
</ul>
The <b>strokeWidth</b> property determines the width of the grid
lines. It also serves as a reminder that you can pass other standard
shape properties in the opts object.

<p>
JS9's label placement algorithm puts labels close to the intersection
of RA and Dec lines. A number of properties can be useful in cases
where this simple algorithm is not sufficient: the <b>raAngle</b>
and <b>decAngle</b> properties allow you to rotate the labels with
respect to the grid lines. The four label[RA,Dec]Off[x,y] properties
allow you to move the label with respect to the grid lines.
The <b>raSkip</b> and <b>decSkip</b> properties allow you to skip
labelling the first available lines within the display. It can be
useful, for example, on a rotated image, when the labels are placed in
a corner.

<p>
The <b>degPrec</b> and <b>sexaPrec</b> properties specify the precision for
degree values and sexagesimal values, respectively. Higher precision will
use more digits and take more space along each line.

<p>
A number of properties are (more or less) internal but might be of
use: the <b>reduceDims</b> property will reduce the <b>raLines</b>
and <b>decLines</b> properties by the ratio of image dimensions if one
dimension is smaller than the other. This can prevent crowding in the
smaller dimension.  The <b>stride</b> property specifies the length of
each line segment that together make up a grid line. A smaller stride
might make the grid lines smoother in some cases, at the price of more
processing time.  The <b>cover</b> property determines whether the
grid is drawn over the entire image or just the displayed part of the
image. At the moment, drawing lines over the displayed part of the
image seems to be sufficient.

<p>
Note that you can specify global site-wide values for all these parameters
(overriding the JS9.Grid.opts defaults) by supplying them in a <b>grid</b>
object within the globalOpts object in the js9prefs.js file.

<p>
Example: display a coordinate grid, specifying the line color:
<pre>
    JS9.DisplayCoordGrid(true, {lineColor: "pink"});
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.CountsInRegions">Get background-subtracted counts in regions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CountsInRegions(sregion, bregion, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>sregion</b>: any source region, or "$sregions" for displayed source regions
<li><b>bregion</b>: any background region, or "$bregions" for displayed background regions
<li><b>opts</b>:  optional object or JSON string containing region parameters
</ul>
The <a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
program (and its predecessor, funcnts) counts photons in specified
source regions and optionally, in specified background regions.
Displayed results include the bkgd-subtracted counts in each region,
as well as the error on the counts, the area in each region, and the
surface brightness (cnts/area**2) calculated for each region. Regcnts
for desktop use is available on
<a href="https://github.com/ericmandel/regions" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

<p>
The regcnts program has been compiled into JS9 using
<a href="https://emscripten.org/" target="_blank">Emscripten</a>.
Using this routine, it can be run on the FITS file stored in memory
for the currently displayed image.  The first two arguments specify
the <b>source region(s)</b> and <b>background region(s)</b>,
respectively. You can pass a standard region specifier as the source
or background region:
<pre>
    JS9.CountsInRegions('ICRS; circle(23:23:18.76, +58:47:27.25, 31.8&#34;)');
</pre>
If the string "$sregions" ("$bregions") is
specified, the source (background) regions are taken from the
currently displayed image. You also can specify a region selector
using a <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a> string.
For example:
<pre>
    # all regions
    JS9.CountsInRegions('all');
    # selected regions
    JS9.CountsInRegions('selected');
    # regions tagged with the "foo" tag
    JS9.CountsInRegions('foo');
</pre>
Note that if you pass a region selector and no regions are returned,
the routine will throw an error. Also note that, in this context, text
and cross regions not valid regions (and are ignored).

<p>
In keeping with how desktop regcnts works, if no argument or null or a
null string is specified as the source region, the entire field is
used as the source region. If no argument or null or a null string is
explicitly specified as a background region, no regions are used for
the background.  In particular, if you pass only the source region
argument, or pass only the source region and opts arguments, no
background region is used. To recap:
<pre>
    # use entire field, no background
    JS9.CountsInRegions([opts])
    JS9.CountsInRegions("field"||null||""[, opts])

    # use displayed source and displayed background
    JS9.CountsInRegions("$sregions", "$bregions"[, opts])

    # use displayed source, no background
    JS9.CountsInRegions("$sregions"[, opts])

    # use displayed source and specified background
    JS9.CountsInRegions("$sregions", bregions[, opts])

    # use specified source, no background
    JS9.CountsInRegions(sregions[, opts])

    # use specified source and specified background
    JS9.CountsInRegions(sregions, bregions[, opts])

    # use specified source and displayed background
    JS9.CountsInRegions(sregions, "$bregions"[, opts])

   # use entire field and specified background
    JS9.CountsInRegions("field"||null||"", bregions[, opts])

    # use entire field and displayed background
    JS9.CountsInRegions("field"||null||"", "$bregions"[, opts])
</pre>

The third argument allows you to specify options to regcnts:
<ul>
<li><b>cmdswitches</b>: command line switches passed to regcnts
<li><b>dim</b>: size of reduced image (def: max of JS9.globalOpts.image.[xdim,ydim])
<li><b>reduce</b>: reduce image size? (def: true)
<li><b>lightwin</b>: if true, results are displayed in a light window
</ul>
The command line switches that can be specified in <b>cmdswitches</b> are
detailed in the
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts help
page</a>.  Aside from switches which control important aspects of the
analysis, the "-j" switch (which returns the output in JSON format)
might be useful in the browser environment. Some examples:
<pre>
    # display results in a light window
    JS9.CountsInRegions({lightwin: true})

    # return JSON using maximum precision in output
    JS9.CountsInRegions({cmdswitches: "-j -G"})
</pre>
Results are also returned as a text string.

<p>
The regcnts code is memory (and cpu) intensive. In the desktop
environment, this is not typically a problem, but the
memory-constrained browser environment can present a challenge for
large images and binary tables.  To avoid running out of memory (and
for large images, to speed up processing considerably), the
JS9.CountsInRegions() routine will bin the image to reduce its size,
unless the <b>reduce</b> option is explicitly set to false. The binned
image size can be specified by the <b>dim</b> option, defaulting to
the global value of the image dimension options. When a file is binned
in this manner, the returned resolution value (e.g., arcsec/pixel)
will reflect the applied binning. Note that the number of photons
found inside a binned and unbinned region differ slightly, due to the
difference in the pixel boundaries in the two cases.

<p>
The <b>Counts in Regions</b> option of the <b>Analysis -> Client-side
Analysis</b> menu runs regcnts on the source and background regions of
the currently displayed image. The results are displayed in a light window.

<p>
Finally, note that the main <a href="https://js9.si.edu" target="_blank">JS9 web
site</a> also offers regcnts as a server-based analysis program in the
Analysis menu. The displayed source and background regions are passed
to the server for processing. Because this version runs the desktop
program, it runs on the original file and does no binning to reduce
the image size (which, by the way, could lengthen the processing
time.) But the server-side task also can be useful for
<a href="./repfile.html">large file support</a>, which involves
displaying a small representation file associated with a much larger
parent file stored on the server. In this case, you often want to run
the analysis on the larger (original) file.

<h5 id="JS9.RadialProfile">Generate a radial profile plot</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RadialProfile(sregion, bregion, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>sregion</b>: annulus region, or "$sregions" to use displayed annulus
<li><b>bregion</b>: any background region, or "$bregions" for displayed background regions
<li><b>opts</b>:  optional object or JSON string containing region and plot parameters
</ul>
The <b>JS9.RadialProfile()</b> routine
uses <a href="#JS9.CountsInRegions"><b>JS9.CountsInRegions()</b></a>
to produce a radial profile plot. The source region argument should be
an annulus region (or, when using "$sregions", the displayed source
region should be an annulus.) The background region can be any
region(s) (except text or cross regions), the same as for the counts
routine.

<p>
The third argument allows you to specify options to the counts routine,
as well as the following options for the radial profile plot:
<ul>
<li><b>color</b>: color of the plot line (default: "green")
<li><b>errorbars</b>: show error bars? (default: true)
<li><b>errorcolor</b>: color of the error bars (default: "red")
</ul>
Note that "-j" (JSON format) and "-r" (output radii) are always added to
the cmdswitches property (and should not be overridden.) This means you can
retrieve the JSON output without generating the plot simply by calling
<a href="#JS9.CountsInRegions"><b>JS9.CountsInRegions()</b></a> directly:
<pre>
    JS9.CountsInRegions(sregions, bregions, {cmdswitches: "-j -r"})
</pre>
The return value is the id of the light window containing the plot.

<h5 id="JS9.RawDataLayer">Create or modify a raw data layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RawDataLayer(opts, func)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>opts</b>: layer name or opts object
<li><b>func</b>: function used to create or modify raw data
</ul>
Each image has raw data associated with it, i.e., the underlying
astronomical image pixels that are scaled and displayed using the
chosen scale and colormap. You can manipulate the raw data by creating
a new <b>raw data layer</b> using <b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b>,
setting
the image pixel values, and then making this layer the current
one. The original raw data (with id "raw0") will be maintained in
separate layer, so you can switch between layers (also using this
routine.)

<p>
To create a new raw data layer (or edit an existing layer), call the
<b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b> with two arguments: layer opts (or layer
name) and a function. The layer opts object can have the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>rawid</b>: id of new raw data layer (default: "alt")
<li><b>oraw</b>: id of raw data layer to pass to func or "current" (default: "raw0", i.e., the original data)
<li><b>from</b>: descriptive string describing origin of this raw data (def: "func")
</ul>
Alternative, you can pass the id of the raw data layer as a string and
use the defaults for the other properties (which usually is sufficient.)

<p>
The pixel modifying function should have the following calling sequence:
<pre>
    func(oraw, nraw, opts)
</pre>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>oraw</b>: the raw data object specified by the <b>from</b> property above (def: original raw data "raw0");
<li><b>nraw</b>: the raw data layer you are modifying
<li><b>opts</b>: the original opts object along with any params you add to it
</ul>
The function should return <b>true</b> is you want to switch to the new layer
and display it, or <b>false</b> to discard the new layer (in case of an error.)

<p>
Note that the <b>nraw</b> object will contain the raw data for this
layer, if it already exists. Otherwise, it will contain a copy of
the <b>from</b> data.

<p>
For example, the following routine creates a new "clip" layer and
clips the original raw data at the specified nmax level:
<pre>
    im.rawData({rawid: "clip", nmax: n}, function (oraw, nraw, opts){
        var i, len;
        opts = opts || {};
        if( opts.nmax === undefined ){ opts.nmax = 0; }
        len = nraw.width * nraw.height;
        for(i=0; i&lt;len; i++){
            if( oraw.data[i] &lt; opts.nmax ){
                nraw.data[i] = 0;
            } else {
                nraw.data[i] = oraw.data[i];
            }
        }
        return true;
    });
</pre>
When clipping, the nraw pixel values are taken from the oraw values, so
that you can clip to a value of 100, then clip to a value of 50, and
get the right result. This is different from the following example "add"
layer, which adds a constant value to the existing data:
<pre>
    im.rawData({rawid: "add", val: n}, function (oraw, nraw, opts){
        var i, len;
        opts = opts || {};
        if( opts.val === undefined ){
            opts.val = 1;
        }
        len = nraw.width * nraw.height;
        for(i=0; i&lt;len; i++){
            nraw.data[i] += opts.val;
        }
        return true;
    });
</pre>
Here, the operation is performed on the existing "add" layer each time, so
that the addition is cumulative.

<p>
The oraw and nraw objects contain a subset of the properties returned by
<a href="#JS9.GetImageData"><b>JS9.GetImageData()</b></a>:
<ul>
<li><b>width</b>: x dimension of image
<li><b>height</b>: y dimension of image
<li><b>bitpix</b>: FITS bits/pixel of each image element (8 for unsigned char, 16, 32 for signed integer, -32 or -64 for float)
<li><b>header</b>: JavaScript object containing FITS header values
<li><b>data</b>: buffer containing raw data values
</ul>

<p>
To switch to a layer, call <b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b>
with a single argument, the layer name:
<pre>
    JS9.RawDataLayer("raw0")   # switch to original data
    JS9.RawDataLayer("clip")   # switch to clipped data
    JS9.RawDataLayer("add")    # switch to add data
</pre>
To get the currently displayed layer, call the routine with no arguments:
<pre>
    JS9.RawDataLayer()         # returns "clip"
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.GaussBlurData">Gaussian blur of raw data</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.GaussBlurData(sigma, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>sigma</b>: sigma of Gaussian function
<li><b>opts</b>: options object
</ul>
This routine creates a new raw data layer called "gaussBlur" in which
the image pixel values are blurred using a Gaussian function with the
specified sigma. The routine uses the fast Gaussian blur algorithm
(approximating a full Gaussian blur with three passes of a box blur)
described <a href="http://blog.ivank.net/fastest-gaussian-blur.html" target="_blank">
here</a>.
<p>
See <a href="#JS9.RawDataLayer"><b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b></a> for more
information about raw data layers.

<h5 id="JS9.ImarithData">Perform image arithmetic on raw data</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ImarithData(op, arg1, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>op</b>: image operation: "add", "sub", "mul", "div", "min", "max", and "reset"
<li><b>arg1</b>: image handle, image id or numeric value
<li><b>opts</b>: options object
</ul>
The <b>JS9.ImarithData()</b> routine performs basic arithmetic
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, minimum, maximum, average)
between the currently displayed image and either another image or a
constant value. The first <b>op</b> argument is a string, as detailed
above. The second <b>arg1</b> argument can be a numeric value or an
image id. In the former case, the constant value is applied to each
pixel in the image. In the latter case, the operation is performed
between the corresponding pixels in the two images. For example:
<pre>
    JS9.ImarithData("max", "foo.fits");
</pre>
will make a new data layer of the currently displayed image, where
each pixel is the larger value from that image and the foo.fits image
(which can be in any display.)

<p>
This routine creates a new raw data layer called "imarith" containing
the results of the operation. Successive calls to this routine are
cumulative, so that you can build up a more complex operation from
simple ones. For example:
<pre>
    # foo.fits is displayed in the "myJS9" display
    var myim = JS9.GetImage({display: "myJS9"});
    JS9.ImarithData("max", myim);
    JS9.ImarithData("add", 2.718);
</pre>
will make a new data layer where each pixel is the larger value from
the two images, after which an approximation of the irrational number
e is added to each pixel. 

<p>
The special <b>reset</b> operation deletes the "imarith" raw data
layer, allowing you to start afresh.

<p>
The bitpix value of the new "imarith" layer is chosen as follows:
<ul>
<li> for operations between two images, bitpix the "larger" of the two
images (where float is "larger" than int.)
<li> for operations between an image and a constant, bitpix of -32
(single float) is chosen unless the image itself has bitpix of -64, in
which case the double float bitpix is chosen.
</ul>
You can override the choice of bitpix by passing a <b>bitpix</b> property
in the optional opts object.

<p>
Finally, note that the two images must have the same dimensions. We
might be able to remove this restriction in the future, although
it is unclear how one lines up images of different dimensions.
<p>
See <a href="#JS9.RawDataLayer"><b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b></a> for more
information about raw data layers.

<h5 id="JS9.ShiftData">Shift raw data</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ShiftData(x, y, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>x</b>: number of pixels to shift in the x (width) direction
<li><b>y</b>: number of pixels to shift in the y (height) direction
<li><b>opts</b>: options object
</ul>
This routine creates a new raw data layer called "shift" in which
the pixels are shifted from the original image array by the specified
amount in x and/or y. The results of successive shifts are
cumulative. The routine is used by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics MicroObservatory project interactively to align images
that are only slightly offset from one another.
<p>
See <a href="#JS9.RawDataLayer"><b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b></a> for more
information about raw data layers.

<h5 id="JS9.ReprojectData">Reproject an image using a specified WCS</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ReprojectData(wcsim, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>wcsim</b>: image containing the WCS used to perform the reprojection
<li><b>opts</b>: options object for raw data layer
</ul>
<b>JS9.ReprojectData()</b> creates a new raw data layer (with default id
of "reproject") in which the pixels are reprojected using the WCS from
another image. The
<a href="http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/mProjectPP.html" target="_blank">mProjectPP</a>
program from the 
<a href="http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Montage</a> software suite
is used to perform the reprojection.  Please read the documentation on
mProjectPP from the Montage web site, which includes this explanation:
<p>
<pre>
    mProjectPP performs a plane-to-plane transform on the input image, and
    is an adaptation of the Mopex algorithm and developed in collaboration
    with the Spitzer Space Telescope. It provides a speed increase of
    approximately a factor of 30 over the general-purpose mProject. However,
    mProjectPP is only suitable for projections which can be approximated
    by tangent-plane projections (TAN, SIN, ZEA, STG, ARC), and is therefore
    not suited for images covering large portions of the sky. Also note that
    it does not directly support changes in coordinate system (i.e., equatorial
    to galactic coordinates), though these changes can be facilitated by the
    use of an alternate header.
</pre>
These Montage programs have been compiled into JS9 using
<a href="https://emscripten.org/" target="_blank">Emscripten</a>.

<p>
The <b>wcsim</b> argument is an image id, image filename, or image
object pointing to the WCS image. This is the image whose WCS will be used
for the reprojection. Alternatively, if the <b>wcsim</b> argument is set to
"all", the WCS from the currently displayed image will be used to reproject
all other images in the display.

<p>
The <b>opts</b> object can contain the following reproject-specific properties:
<ul>
<li><b>rawid</b>: the id of the raw data layer to create (default: "reproject")
<li><b>cmdswitches</b>: a string containing mProjectPP command line switches
</ul>
The cmdswitches will be prepended to the mProjectPP command line. For example:
<pre>
 {cmdswitches: "-d 1 -z .75"}
</pre>
will set the mProjectPP debugging and the drizzle factor, resulting in a
command line that looks like this:
<pre>
  mProjectPP -d 1 -z .75 -s statusfile in.fits out.fits template.hdr
</pre>
See the 
<a href="http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/mProjectPP.html" target="_blank">mProjectPP</a>
documentation for more information about command switches.

<p>
Reprojection is an intensive process which can take a considerable
amount of memory and processing time. It also (at least currently)
requires that the full reprojected image be displayed (so that the
reprojected image can be properly aligned with the WCS image used in
making the reprojection.)  We therefore restrict the WCS image size to
be less than or equal to JS9.globalOpts.image.xdim by
JS9.globalOpts.image.ydim. If the WCS image exceeds this size, an
error is thrown.
<p>
See <a href="#JS9.RawDataLayer"><b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b></a> for more
information about raw data layers.

<h5 id="JS9.RotateData">Rotate an image around the WCS CRPIX point</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RotateData(angle, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>angle</b>: rotation angle in degrees
<li><b>opts</b>: options object
</ul>
The <b>JS9.RotateData()</b> routine uses
<a href="#JS9.ReprojectData"><b>JS9.ReprojectData()</b></a>
to rotate image data by the specified angle (in degrees.) If the string
"northup" or "northisup" is specified, the rotation angle is set to 0.
By default, the rotation is performed about the WCS CRPIX1, CRPIX2 point.
To rotate about the center of the currently displayed image, pass
the <b>opts.center</b> property with a value of "current" or (globally)
set the <b>JS9.globalOpts.rotationCenter</b> property to "current".
<p>
Note that this rotation is not accumulative (as is the case with the
<a href="#JS9.SetRotate"><b>JS9.SetRotate()</b></a> and 
<a href="#JS9.SetRot90"><b>JS9.SetRot90()</b></a> routines), so
calling <b>JS9.RotateData()</b> with an angle of 30 degrees followed by
45 degrees will result in a 45 degree rotation, not a 75 degree
rotation.

<p>
The optional opts object is passed directly to the <b>JS9.ReprojectData()</b>
routine. See <b>JS9.ReprojectData()</b> above for more information.

<h5 id="JS9.FilterRGBImage">Apply a filter to the RGB image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.FilterRGBImage(filter, args)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filter</b>: name of image filter to apply to the RGB data
<li><b>args</b>: filter-specific arguments, where applicable
</ul>
In JS9, you can change the raw data (and hence the displayed image) using
routines such as
<a href="#JS9.GaussBlurData"><b>JS9.GaussBlurData()</b></a>
or the more general
<a href="#JS9.RawDataLayer"><b>JS9.RawDataLayer()</b></a>.
You also can apply image processing
techniques directly to the displayed RGB image without changing the
underlying raw data, using this routine. The web has an overwhelming
amount of information about image processing.  A good technical
article concerning the use of image filters with Javascript and the
HTML5 canvas is available at:
<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/" target="_blank">
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/
</a>

<p>
The <b>JS9.FilterRGBImage()</b> routine supports a number of image
processing routines, which are listed below.  To call one of them
using <b>JS9.FilterRGBImage()</b>, supply the filter name, followed by any
filter-specific arguments, e.g.:
<pre>
    JS9.FilterRGBImage("luminance", {display: "myJS9"});
    JS9.FilterRGBImage("duotone", "g", {display: "myJS9"});
    JS9.FilterRGBImage("convolve", [-1,-1,-1,-1,8,-1,-1,-1,-1]);
</pre>
You can, of course, use the default arguments where applicable.

<p>
Note that the standard JS9 colormaps, scale, contrast and bias
selections are applied to the raw data to regenerate the RGB
image. Thus, if you use any of the image processing techniques listed
below and then change colormap, contrast, bias, or scale, you will
undo the applied image processing. This is a good way to reset the
displayed image. The same thing can be accomplished programmatically by
specifying "reset" as the filter name:
<pre>
    JS9.FilterRGBImage("reset", {display: "myJS9"});
</pre>

<p>
The following simple image processing filters are available:
<ul>
<li><b>luminance():</b>convert to greyscale using the CIE luminance:
0.2126*r + 0.7152*g + 0.0722*b
<li><b>greyscale():</b>convert to greyscale using the standard greyscale:
0.3*r + 0.59*g + 0.11*b
<li><b>greyscaleAvg():</b>convert to greyscale using averaging:

defaults are v1=-30, v2=30
<li><b>duotone("r"|"g"|"b"):</b> remove a color by setting it to
the avg of the two others: r=(g+b)/2, default color is "r"
<li><b>invert():</b> the RGB channels of the image are inverted:

<li><b>pixelate(size):</b>make image look coarser by creating a square tiling
effect of the specified size, default size is 2
<li><b>sepia():</b> image takes on shades of brown, like an antique photograph
<li><b>contrast(val):</b> change the difference in brightness between the min

<li><b>threshold(thresh, low, high):</b>create a two-color image in which pixels
less bright than thresh are assigned the low value (default 0 for black), 
otherwise the high value (default: 255 for white)
<li><b>gamma(gcorr):</b> apply the nonlinear gamma operation, used to code and

</ul>

<p>
The following image convolutions are available:
<ul>
<li><b>convolve(weights, [opaque])</b> convolve the image using the weights array
as a square convolution matrix. If opaque is true (default), the image will 
have an opaque alpha channel, otherwise the alpha is convolved as well.
<li><b>sobel():</b> use the Sobel operator to create an image that emphasizes the edges
<li><b>medianFilter():</b> noise reduction technique that replaces each pixel with

default val of 6/9 darkens the image
</ul>

<p>
With no arguments, the routine returns an array of available filters:
<pre>
    JS9.FilterRGBImage()
    ["convolve", "luminance", ..., "blur", "emboss", "lighten", "darken"]
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.SaveSession">Save an image session to a file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SaveSession(session, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>session</b>: optional name of the file to create when saving this session
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object or JSON string containing session parameters
</ul>
<p>
This routine saves session information related to the currently
displayed image or all images in the specified display. The first
argument can be a filename or an options object. If a filename is
specified, the second argument can be the options object.
<p>
The <b>opts</b> options object supports a <b>mode</b> property
whose value can be "display" (save all images in the specified
display) or "image" (save the currently displayed image. If this
property is not specified, the default is to save all images in the display.
<p>
If no filename is specified, the default filename depends on the save mode.
If mode is "display", the default filename takes the form <b>js9-[date].ses</b>,
e.g., "js9-2018-01-09.ses". If mode is "image", the default filename is <b>[im.id].ses</b>, e.g., "casa.fits.ses".
<p>
Saved information (filename, scaling, colormap, contrast/bias, zoom,
regions, catalogs, etc) is stored in a JSON-formatted text file. You can
subsequently load this file into JS9 to restore the image session.
Don't forget that the file is saved by the browser in whatever location
you have set up for downloads.
<p>
The session file is a text file and can be edited, subject to the usual
rules of JSON formatting. For example, you can change the colormap,
scaling, etc. after the fact.
<p>
The session file contains a <b>file</b> property near the top that
specifies the location of the image. A local file usually will contain
an absolute path or a path relative to the web page being displayed.
However, if the image was originally opened using drag-and-drop, no
pathname information is available, in accordance with standard web
security protocols. In this case, you must edit the session file to
supply the path (either absolute or relative to the web page) before
re-loading the session.

<h5 id="JS9.LoadSession">Load a previously saved image session from a file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.LoadSession(session)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>session</b>: name of the session file to load
</ul>
<p>
Restore an image session by loading a JSON-formatted session file. The
image itself is retrieved and loaded, and all of the saved parameters
and graphics (scale, colormap, regions, catalogs etc) are applied to
the display.
<p>
The pathname of the session file should either be absolute or should be
relative to the web page.
<p>
The session file contains a <b>file</b> property near the top that
specifies the location of the image. For browser-based JS9, a local
file usually will contain an absolute path or a path relative to the
web page being displayed.

<p>
On the desktop, session files and the associated data files often are
moved around or used with different web pages, breaking the connection
between the web page and the image path.  To deal with this problem,
the <b>JS9.desktoplOpts.sessionPath</b> variable is provided:
<ul>
<li> if set to <b>true</b>, the image path is relative to the location
of the session file (this is the default)
<li> if set to <b>false</b>, the image path is relative to the web page
value (as with browser-based JS9)
</ul>
This means that if you store your session file relative to the
contained image, you can move both files to any location on your disk.

<p>
If the image was originally opened using drag-and-drop, no pathname
information is available, in accordance with standard web security
protocols. In this case, you may have to edit the session file to
supply the path (either absolute or relative) before re-loading the
session.

<p>
Note that the raw data file itself is not saved (only its pathname),
so you must have access to that file in order to restore a session. However,
the data file need not be in the same location as it was originally: you
can adjust the path of the data file by editing the <b>file</b> property
as needed.

<h4 id="regions">Working with Regions</h4>
  
<p>
Spatial regions of interest are a crucial part of astronomical data
analysis, especially X-ray analysis. Programs having spatial region
support can select parts of a FITS image or binary table using simple
geometric shapes, so that only pixels found within these shapes are
processed. See
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regions.html" target="_blank">regions</a>
for a general discussion of spatial region filtering in astronomy, and
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
for an example program using spatial regions.

<p>
JS9's support for spatial regions allows you to create and delete
regions, load them from an external file, change characteristics such as
size and color, use them as selection criteria in local analysis or
pass them to remote analysis, and export them a file.

<p>
The regions layer in JS9 is a special case of the more generalized
<b><a href="#shapes">Shape</a></b> layers, but it is automatically created by
JS9 to support the options in the <b>Regions</b> menu, as well as
local and server-side data analysis using regions. As such, the
region routines are just a thin layer on top of the Shape routines,
calling the equivalent Shape routine with "region" as the first argument.

<h5 id="selectregions">Selecting Regions</h5>

One of the most important aspects of using regions is the ability to assign
different characteristics to regions and then make selections based on
these characteristics. The
<b><a href="#JS9.ChangeRegions">JS9.ChangeRegions()</a></b>,
<b><a href="#JS9.GetRegions">JS9.GetRegions()</a></b>,
<b><a href="#JS9.ListRegions">JS9.ListRegions()</a></b>,
<b><a href="#JS9.RemoveRegions">JS9.RemoveRegions()</a></b>,
and
<b><a href="#JS9.SelectRegions">JS9.SelectRegions()</a></b>
<b><a href="#JS9.GroupRegions">JS9.GroupRegions()</a></b>
calls all take a region selection specification as the first argument,
which can be any of the following (in order of precedence):
<ul>
<li><b>selected</b>: the selected region (or all regions in selected group)
<li><b>all</b>: all regions, but not including child text regions (default)
<li><b>All</b>: all regions, including child text regions
<li><b>[id]</b>: a integer region id (or an array of ids), as
returned by <a href="#JS9.AddRegions"><b>JS9.AddRegions()</b></a>
<li><b>[color]</b>: all regions having the specified color (e.g., "red")
<li><b>[shape]</b>: all regions having the specified shape (e.g., "circle")
<li><b>child</b>: a child region (i.e. text child of another region)
<li><b>parent</b>: a region that has a child (i.e. has a text child)
<li><b>[wcs]</b>:  regions whose initial wcs matches the specified wcs
<li><b>[tag]</b>: all regions containing the specified tag (e.g., "source")
<li><b>/[regexp]/</b>: all regions whose tags match the regexp (e.g. "/foo[1-4]/")
<li><b>dcoords</b>: a region that preserves display coordinates
<li><b>nodcoords</b>: a region that does not preserve display coordinates
</ul>
Of these, <b>all</b>, <b>selected</b>, <b>[color]</b>, <b>[shape]</b>, and
<b>[tag]</b> are probably the most often used. Selections make it
possible to act on multiple regions at the same time. For example:
<pre>
    # all currently selected regions
    JS9.ListRegions("selected");

    # all circles
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle", {"color": "red"});

    # all red regions
    JS9.GetRegions("red");
  
    # all regions with the tag 'foo1'
    JS9.ChangeRegions("foo1", {"color": "red"});
  
    # all regions with a tag matching the regular expression foo.*
    JS9.ListRegions("/foo.*/");

    # region with id 7
    JS9.SelectRegions(7, {"color": "red"});
</pre>
In addition, you can combine selections using the boolean operators,
with the usual precedence and associativity rules holding sway:
<pre>
  Operator                                Associativity
  --------                                -------------
  !  (bitwise not)                        right to left
  && (logical and)                        left to right
  || (logical or)                         left to right
</pre>
For example:
<pre>
    # circles or ellipses
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle || ellipse", {"color": "red"});

    # circles or red regions
    JS9.ListRegions("circle || red");

    # circles having tag 'foo1'
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle && foo1", {"color": "red"});

    # circles not having tag 'foo2'
    JS9.SelectRegions("circle && !foo2");

    # all regions except red ones
    JS9.ChangeRegions("!red", {"color": "cyan"});

    # not selected regions
    JS9.ChangeRegions("!selected", {"color": "cyan"});

    # circles having tag 'foo1' and ellipses having tag 'foo2'
    JS9.GetRegions("(circle && foo1) || (ellipse && foo2)");
</pre>
When a region selection is made using the
<b><a href="#JS9.ChangeRegions">JS9.ChangeRegions()</a></b> or
<b><a href="#JS9.SelectRegions">JS9.SelectRegions()</a></b> calls, the
selection is saved so that you can use it as part of subsequent selection
calls. You can specify use of the saved selection either in the opts object
or directly in the selection string:
<pre>
    # select circle regions and save selection filter
    JS9.SelectRegions("circle")

    # select saved regions, along with ellipses that have a "foo1" tag
    JS9.SelectRegions("ellipse && foo1", {"saved": true})

    # select saved regions, along with ellipses that have a "foo1" tag
    JS9.SelectRegions("ellipse && foo1", {"saved": "or"})

    # select saved regions, along with ellipses that have a "foo1" tag
    JS9.SelectRegions("saved || (ellipse && foo1)")

    # select saved regions if they are ellipses that have a "foo1" tag
    JS9.SelectRegions("ellipse && foo1", {"saved": "and"})

    # select saved regions if they are ellipses that have a "foo1" tag
    JS9.SelectRegions("saved && ellipse && foo1")

    # retrieve currently saved regions
    JS9.ListRegions('saved')
</pre>
Calling <b><a href="#JS9.SelectRegions">JS9.SelectRegions("reset")</a></b>
will clear the saved selection.

<h5 id="JS9.AddRegions">Add one or more regions to the regions layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">id = JS9.AddRegions(rarr, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>rarr</b>: a shape string, region object or an array of region objects
<li><b>opts</b>: global values to apply to each created region
</ul>
returns:

</ul>
The <b>rarr</b> argument can be a region shape ("annulus", "box",
"circle", "cross", "ellipse", "point", "polygon", "text"), a single region
object, or an array of region objects. Region objects contain one or
more properties, of which the most important are:
<ul>

<li><b>data</b>: this property can be an object, string, number,
etc. and will be carried along with the region, and returned as a
property by the <b>JS9.GetRegions()</b> call.
</ul>
Other available properties include:
<ul>
<li><b>changeable</b>: if false, region cannot be moved, resized, rotated
<li><b>locked</b>: 'opposite alias' of changeable

<li><b>preservedcoords</b>: if true, the region is sticky, and display coordinates are preserved during save and copy operations (see below for more info)
</ul>
Here are some examples of ways to create regions:
<pre>
    # example 1: circular region in the center of the field
    JS9.AddRegions("circle");

    # example 2: red circular region in the center of the field
    JS9.AddRegions("circle", {color: "red"});

    # example 3: red circular region with dashed lines
    JS9.AddRegions("circle", {color: "red", strokeDashArray: [3,1]});

    # example 4: regions using an object in first arg
    JS9.AddRegions({shape: "circle", color: "red", strokeDashArray: [3,1]})

    # example 5: multiple regions using an array specification in first arg
    JS9.AddRegions([{shape: "circle", color: "red", strokeDashArray: [3,1]},
                    {shape: "box", color: "green", strokeDashArray: [6,1]}])

    # example 6: js9 region syntax: properties in the second arg object
    JS9.AddRegions('ellipse(23:23:22.179, +58:48:10.542, 40", 20", 60)', {text: "ellipse test", color: "violet", tags: "json tag, another tag", textOpts: {color: "yellow", fontSize: 16, fontStyle: "italic", fontWeight: "bold"}});

    # example 7: js9 region syntax: JSON properties in the first arg string
    JS9.AddRegions('ellipse(23:23:22.179, +58:48:10.542, 40", 20", 60) {"color": "violet", "text": "ellipse test", "textOpts": {"color": "yellow", "fontSize": 16, "fontStyle": "italic", "fontWeight": "bold"}} # json tag, another tag');

    # example 8: ds9 region syntax: comment properties in the first arg string
    JS9.AddRegions('box(23:23:35.486, +58:50:03.146, 40", 20", 30) # width=4 text={box test} dash=1 color=red rotate=0 tag="test tag"')

    # example 9: create a region at the specified RA and Dec using ICRS
    # Note that the WCS string is returned by the Edit menu's "copy wcs pos"
    # option (i.e., the "/" keystroke.)
    JS9.AddRegions("circle", {wcs: "23:23:28.895 +58:49:43.50 ICRS"});

    # example 10: create a region by supplying display (screen) coordinates
    image
    text(d250, d100, "Using Display Coordinates")

    # example 11: create a region by supplying display (screen) coordinates
    # preserve the display coordinate when saving, copying
    # and don't move the region when panning, zooming
    image
    text(d250, d100, "Using and Preserving Display Coordinates:") {"preservedcoords": true}

</pre>
In sum, you can specify a region using:
<ul>
<li> a shape in the first string arg, optional properties in the second object arg
<li> properties (including the shape) in the first object arg
<li> array of objects in the first arg
<li> full region syntax in the first string arg, optional properties in the second arg
</ul>
Note the difference between examples 6 and 7: the former passes
properties in an <b>object</b> (second argument), so the key names
need not be quoted. The latter passes properties in a <b>JSON</b>
string as part of the first string argument: here the key names must be
quoted using double quotes, as per the JSON specification.

<p>
Examples 6 and 7 also show the <b>text</b> property, which allows you
to associate a text string with a non-text region. JS9 will create a
separate text region as a <b>child</b> of the original region. You can
move this child text region around relative to the original region,
change its angle, etc. The child will then maintain its new position
relative to the original region as the latter is moved, resized,
etc. You also can double-click on the text child to bring up its
configuration dialog box and change its color, font, size, text string,
etc.

<p>
Examples 10 and 11 show several features of regions that might be
useful for marking images with text and shapes that are tied to the
display rather than the image. When using the image coordinate system,
you can prefix the image positions with 'd' or 'D' to indicate that
they should be interpreted as display (also called "screen")
coordinates instead of image coordinates. The origin of the display is
in the upper left corner (image coordinates are in the lower left). By
default, a region specified with display coordinates is no different
from other regions: the region will change its screen position during
zoom and pan operations to stay aligned on the image, and its position
will be saved using the current coordinate system. That is, by default, 
display coordinate are only used in the initial placement of the region.

<p>
To preserve the region's display position during zoom and pan operations
and while saving regions, set the <b>preservedcoords</b> property
to <b>true</b> in the opts object. In this case, the region
is no longer a canonical astronomical region of interest, but is more
like a mark on the screen. By default, it will not be listed by the
<b>Regions list</b> menu option, nor will it be saved by default (although
you can set the <b>save dcoords regions</b> to <b>true</b> in the regions
save dialog box, or set <b>savedcoords</b> to <b>true</b> in the opts
property of the
<a href="#JS9.SaveRegions"><b>JS9.SaveRegions()</b></a> routine.)
It also will not be passed to back-end server analysis routines that
specify <b>$regions, $sregions, $bregions</b> in their command line.
However, it will be copied from one image to another when using the
<a href="#JS9.CopyRegions"><b>JS9.CopyRegions()</b></a> routine.
These behaviors are parameterized in the JS9.globalOpts object:
<ul>
<li><b>regListDCoords:</b>  list preserved display coords? (def: false)
<li><b>regSaveDCoords:</b> save preserved display coords?  (def: false)
<li><b>regExpandDCoords:</b> pass preserved display coords? to analysis (def: false)
<li><b>regCopyDCoords:</b> copy preserved display coords? (def: true)
</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.GetRegions">Get information about one or more regions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">rarr = JS9.GetRegions(regions, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to retrieve
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>rarr</b>: array of region objects (or text if opts.format is "text")
</ul>
<p>
Get information about one or more regions.
The first argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.
If not specified, it defaults to "selected" if there are selected regions,
otherwise "all".

<p>
Each returned region object contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: numeric region id (assigned by JS9 automatically)
<li><b>mode</b>: "add", "remove", "select", "update"
<li><b>shape</b>: region shape ("annulus", "box", "circle", "cross", "ellipse",
"point", "polygon", "text")
<li><b>tags</b>: comma delimited list of region tags (e.g., "source", "include")
<li><b>color</b>: region color
<li><b>x,y</b>: image coordinates of region
<li><b>radii</b>: array of radii for annulus region
<li><b>width</b>: width for box or cross region
<li><b>height</b>: height for box or cross region
<li><b>radius</b>: radius value for circle region
<li><b>r1</b>:  x radius for ellipse region (misnomer noted)
<li><b>r2</b>:  y radius for ellipse region (misnomer noted)
<li><b>pts</b>: array of objects containing x and y positions, for polygons
<li><b>points</b>: array of objects containing x and y offsets from the specified center, for polygons
<li><b>angle</b>: angle in degrees for box, ellipse, cross regions
<li><b>ra</b>: RA of center in degrees
<li><b>dec</b>: Dec of center in degrees
<li><b>wcsstr</b>: region string in WCS coordinates
<li><b>wcssys</b>: WCS system (e.g., "FK5")
<li><b>imstr</b>: region string in image or physical coordinates
<li><b>imsys</b>: image system ("image" or "physical")
<li><b>lcs</b>: object containing logical x, y and sys (e.g., "physical")
<li><b>parent</b>: the id of the parent region, if this is a text child region
<li><b>child</b>: the id of the child text region, if any
<li><b>data</b>: data property passed in options object when this shape was created.
</ul>
The x, y, radii, pts, radius, width, height, r1, r2 values are all
returned in the image coordinate system. The lcs object will contain x
and y in logical (i.e., physical) coordinates. Moreover, if the
imsys value is not "image" (i.e., the JS9 coordinate system is not
explicitly set to "image"), then the lcs object also will contain
radii, pts, radius, width, height, r1, r2 in the logical coordinate system.
<p>
The image position x, y can be used to access the image data returned by the
<b>JS9.GetImageData()</b> routine:
<pre>
    obj = JS9.GetImageData();
    xreg = JS9.GetRegions("selected")[0];
    val = obj.data[Math.floor(xreg.y-0.5) * obj.width + Math.floor(xreg.x-0.5)];
</pre>
<p>
Note the need to integerize the x and y values: JavaScript arrays are
objects and so floating point array indices do not get truncated
automatically as in C. They will return null values.
<p>
In opts <b>format</b> property is set to "text", the regions are
returned as a string in standard regions format, using semi-colon
delimiters:
<pre>
    JS9.GetRegions("all", {format: "text"})
    ICRS; box(23:23:40.3, +58:47:04.05, 29.5\", 29.5\", 0.0) # background,include; ellipse(23:23:28.06, +58:48:40.5, 14.7\", 15.7\") # source,include
<pre>
By default, the region's json object and comments are passed based on
the value of the <b>globalOpts.regIncludeJSON</b>
and <b>globalOpts.regIncludeComments</b> properties, respectively.
You can override this value by setting the <b>includejson</b>
and <b>includecomments</b> properties in opts.

<p>
You can pass <b>wcssys</b> and <b>wcsunits</b> in opts to return the wcs information in the desired format:
</pre>
    JS9.GetRegions("all", {format: "text"})
    ICRS; circle(23:23:35.300,+58:50:03.600,14&#34;)

    JS9.GetRegions("all", {format: "text", wcsunits: "degrees"})
    ICRS; circle(350.897083,58.834333,0.003889)

    JS9.GetRegions("all", {format: "text", wcssys: "FK4", wcsunits: "degrees"})
    FK4; circle(350.330969,58.559785,0.003889)

    JS9.GetRegions("all", {format: "text", wcsunits: "pixels"})
    physical; circle(3893.94,4091.92,28.46)
</pre>

<p>
If opts <b>format</b> property is set to "regions", the regions are
returned as a new-line separated list, similar to the output of
<a href="#JS9.SaveRegions"><b>JS9.SaveRegions()</b></a>.
By default, this will include the wcs keyword:
<pre>
    JS9.GetRegions("all", {format: "regions"})
    ICRS
    circle(23:23:27.909,+58:48:42.880,14&#34)
    box(23:23:35.486,+58:50:03.146,40.001278,14&#34;,20.000000)
</pre>
<p>
If opts <b>format</b> property is set to "csv", the regions are
returned as a comma-separated value list, using new-line delimiters.
By default, this will not include the wcs keyword:
<pre>
    JS9.GetRegions("all", {format: "csv"})
    circle,23:23:27.909,+58:48:42.880,14&#34;
    box,23:23:35.486,+58:50:03.146,40.001278,14&#34;,20.000000
</pre>
<p>

<h5 id="JS9.ListRegions">List one or more regions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">rstr = JS9.ListRegions(regions, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to list
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>rstr</b>: region string
</ul>
<p>
List (and return) the specified regions. By default, a light window is
displayed listing all regions (i.e., as if the <b>list</b> option of the
<b>Regions</b> menu had been selected.) You can also list "selected" regions
or use any of the standard regions specifications (see introduction to the
<a href="#regions">Regions routines</a> above.)
<p>
The <b>opts</b> object supports the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>mode</b>: display/return mode (1,2,3)
<li><b>wcssys</b>: wcs system to use (ICRS, FK5, galactic, physical, etc.)
<li><b>wcsunits</b>: units for wcs output (sexagesimal, degrees, pixels)
<li><b>includejson</b>: include JSON object
<li><b>includecomments</b>: include comments
<li><b>layer</b>: which layer to display (default is "regions" layer)
</ul>
The mode property accepts the following values:
<ul>
<li><b>1</b>: no display, return full region string including json and comments
<li><b>2</b>: display and return shortened region string (no json or comments)
<li><b>3</b>: display and return full region string (including json and comments)
</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.ListGroups">List groups</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">gstr = JS9.ListGroups(group, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>group</b>: which group to list or "all"
<li><b>opts</b>: optional options object
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>gstr</b>: group string
</ul>
<p>
List the specified region/shape group(s) in the specified layer (default is
"regions").  The first argument is the groupid of the group to list,
or "all" to list all groups.

<p>
The optional opts object can contain the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>includeregions</b>: display regions as well as the group name (default: true)
<li><b>layer</b>: layer to list (default is "regions")
</ul>
By default, the display will includes the name of the group and the
regions in the group. To skip the display of regions, supply
an opts object with the <b>includeregions</b> property set to <b>false</b>.

For example:
<pre>
    JS9.ListGroups("all", {"includeregions": false})
    grp1
    grp2
    grp3

    JS9.ListGroups("grp1")
    grp1:
    circle(3980.00,4120.00,20.00) # source,include,foo1
    ellipse(4090.00,4120.00,25.00,15.00,0.0000) # source,include,foo1
</pre>
<p>
See <a href="#JS9.GroupRegions"><b>JS9.GroupRegions()</b></a>
for more information about region groups.

<h5 id="JS9.EditRegions">Edit one or more selected regions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.EditRegions()</code>
<p>
Edit one or more selected regions using an Edit dialog box. If a
single region has been selected by clicking that region, all of its
properties can be edited via the displayed dialog box. If a group of
regions has been selected using Meta-mousemove to highlight one or
more regions, then properties such as color, stroke width, dash
pattern, and tags can be edited for all of the selected regions using
the displayed dialog box. In the latter case, use shift-click to add
additional regions to the edit group.

<h5 id="JS9.ChangeRegions">Change one or more regions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ChangeRegions(regions, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to change
<li><b>opts</b>: object containing options to change in each region
</ul>
Change one or more regions. 
The first argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.
If not specified, it defaults to "selected" if there are selected regions,
otherwise "all".

<p>
The opts object can contain the parameters 
described in the
<a href="#JS9.AddRegions"><b>JS9.AddRegions()</b></a>
section. However, you cannot (yet)
change the shape itself (e.g., from "box" to "circle".) See js9onchange.html
for examples of how to use this routine.
<p>
By default, if you change the color of a region, the color of the text
associated with that region also will be changed:
<pre>
    # color of text associated with this region also will be changed to red
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle", {"color": "red"});
</pre>
You can turn off synchronization of text colors either by setting the
<b>JS9.globalOpts.regSyncTextColor</b> site property to <b>false</b> or
by setting the <b>synctextcolor</b> option to <b>false</b> in the opts object:
<pre>
    # color of text associated with this region will not be changed to red
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle", {"color":"red", "synctextcolor":false});
</pre>
Note that you also can change the <b>JS9.globalOpts.regSyncTextColor</b>
property via the <b>Global</b> tab of the <b>Preferences</b> plugin.
<p>
If you pass the empty string to <b>color</b>, <b>strokeWidth</b>,
or <b>strokeDashArray</b>, the specified property will be reset as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>color</b>: reset based on source/bkgd include/exclude tags
<li><b>strokeWidth</b>: reset to initial JS9.Fabric.opts.strokeWidth value
<li><b>strokeDashArray</b>: reset to a solid line
</ul>
For example:
<pre>
    # change circles to be red with a dash pattern
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle", {color:"red", strokeDashArray:[3,1]});

    # reset color and dash pattern
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle", {color:"", strokeDashArray:""});
</pre>

<p>

<h5 id="JS9.CopyRegions">Copy one or more regions to another image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CopyRegions(to, regions)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>to</b>: image id to which to copy regions
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to copy
</ul>
Copy regions to a different image. If <b>to</b> is "all", then the regions are
copied to all images.
<p>
The first argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.
If not specified, it defaults to "selected" if there are selected regions,
otherwise "all".

<h5 id="JS9.RemoveRegions">Remove one or more regions from the region layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RemoveRegions(regions)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to remove
</ul>
The selected regions are removed.
The first argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.
If not specified, it defaults to "selected" if there are selected regions,
otherwise "all".

<p>
If <b>JS9.globalOpts.resetEmptyShapeId</b> is set to <b>true</b> (default
is <b>false</b>), the region id counter will be reset to 0 whenever all the
regions are removed.

<h5 id="JS9.UnremoveRegions">Unremove one or more previously removed regions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.UnremoveRegions()</code>
<p>
If you accidentally remove one or more regions, you can use restore
them using this call. JS9 maintains a stack of removed regions (of
size <b>JS9.globalOpts.unremoveReg</b>, current default is 100.) Each
time one or more regions is removed, they are stored as a single entry
on this stack. The <b>UnremoveRegions</b> call pops the last entry off
the stack and calls <b>AddRegions</b>.

<h5 id="JS9.SaveRegions">Save regions from the current image to a file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SaveRegions(filename, which, layer)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filename</b>: output file name
<li><b>which</b>: which regions to save (default is "all")
<li><b>layer</b>: which layer to save (default is "regions")
</ul>
Save the current regions for the displayed image as a JS9 regions text
file. If filename is not specified, the file will be saved as
"js9.reg". If the string "dialogbox" is passed in the filename and no
other arguments are specified, the Save Regions dialogbox is displayed
instead of actually saving regions to a file.

<p>
Don't forget that the file is saved by the browser, in whatever location
you have set up for downloads.

<p>
If the <b>which</b> argument is not specified, it defaults to "all". You
can specify "selected" to return information about the selected regions, or
a tag value to save regions having that tag.

<p>
If the <b>layer</b> argument is not specified, it defaults to
"regions", i.e.,  the usual regions layer. You can specify a different
layer, e.g., if you want to save a catalog layer as a region file
(since <a href="#JS9.SaveCatalog"><b>JS9.SaveCatalog()</b></a>
will save the data in table format instead of as regions.)

<p>
The <b>layer</b> argument can also be an object or a JSON-formatted string
containing these properties:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: the name of the layer
<li><b>format</b>: output format: <b>reg</b>, <b>csv</b>, or <b>svg</b>
<li><b>type</b>: backward compatible alias for <b>format</b> (deprecated)
<li><b>wcssys</b>: wcs system to use (ICRS, FK5, galactic, physical, etc.)
<li><b>wcsunits</b>: units for wcs output (sexagesimal, degrees, pixels)
<li><b>includejson</b>: for reg files, include JSON object in output
<li><b>includecomments</b>: for reg files, include comments in output
<li><b>includewcs</b>: for csv files, include wcs keyword(s) in output
</ul>
If the <b>format</b> is <b>svg</b>, an SVG/XML file will be saved
instead of the standard astronomical regions file. This SVG file can
be imported into programs such as Photoshop for further processing.

<p>
If the <b>format</b> is <b>csv</b>, a text file will be saved with
the regions output as comma separated values:
<pre>
    JS9.SaveRegions("foo", "all", {"format":"csv", "wcsunits":"degrees"})

    circle,350.866288,58.811911,0.004099
    box,350.897858,58.834207,0.011111,0.005556,20.000000
</pre>
Note that the region's wcs keyword is not passed by default in order
to make processing easier. You can force its inclusion by setting
the <b>includewcs</b> property to true.

<p>
If the output format is set to <b>svg (or csv)</b>, the default filename
will be "js9.svg" ("js9.csv") instead of "js9.reg". Similarly, if a
filename is specified that ends in ".svg" (or ".csv"), the format will be
set to <b>svg (csv)</b>.

<h5 id="JS9.ChangeRegionTags">Change region tags for the specified image(s)</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ChangeRegionTags(which, addreg, removereg)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>which</b>: which regions to process (default is "all")
<li><b>addreg</b>: array or comma-delimited string listing regions to add
<li><b>removereg</b>: array or comma-delimited string listing regions to remove
</ul>
While region tags can be changed wholesale using the
<a href="#JS9.ChangeRegions"><b>JS9.ChangeRegions()</b></a> routine,
this routine allows you to add and/or remove specific tags. The first
argument specifies which regions to change. The second argument is a
list of tags to add, while the third argument is a list of tags to
remove. In each case, the tags argument can be an array of tag strings
or a single string containing a comma-separated list of tags:
<pre>
    JS9.ChangeRegionTags("selected", ["foo1", "foo2"], ["goo1", "goo2"]);
    JS9.ChangeRegionTags("selected", "foo1,foo2", "goo1,goo2");
</pre>
Each of the above routines adds two "foo" tags and removes two "goo"
tags from the selected region(s).

<h5 id="JS9.SelectRegions">Gather Regions into a Temporary Selection</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SelectRegions(regions)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to select
</ul>
JS9 has a rich mouse-based interface for selecting regions: a single
region is selected by clicking on it. A number of regions can be
gathered into a temporary selection by pressing the left mouse button and
dragging the mouse over the desired regions. To add to an
already-existing selection, shift-click the mouse on a region.

<p>
A regions selection can be moved, resized, or retrieved as a
single unit. The selection is destroyed when the mouse is clicked
outside the selection, or when
<a href="#JS9.UnselectRegions"><b>JS9.UnselectRegions()</b></a>
is called.

<p>
This routine allows you to create a selection programmatically by
specifying which regions make up the selection.  The first argument is
the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.  If not
specified, it defaults to "all" (since it doesn't make sense to
default to the already-selected regions, does it?).  The result of the
call will be a selection of regions which can be moved as one unit.

<p>
For example:
<pre>
    # select all circles
    JS9.SelectRegions("circle");

    # select all circles not having tag 'foo2'
    JS9.SelectRegions("circle && !foo2");
</pre>

<p>
Regions in a selection are processed individually,
i.e. a <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a> will match
the regions inside a group. Thus for example, if you create a
selection containing circles, changing the color using the "circle"
specification will also affect the circles within the selection. You
can, of course, process only the regions inside a selection using
the <b>selected</b> specification.

<p>
To create more long-lived groups (i.e., which are not destroyed
when you click the mouse outside the region), see
<a href="#JS9.GroupRegions"><b>JS9.GroupRegions()</b></a>.

<h5 id="JS9.UnselectRegions">Remove Regions From a Selection</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.UnselectRegions(regions)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to unselect
</ul>
JS9 has a rich mouse-based interface for selecting regions: a single
region is selected by clicking on it. A number of regions can be
gathered into a group selection by pressing the left mouse button and
dragging the mouse over the desired regions. To add to an
already-existing selection, shift-click the mouse on a region.

<p>
This routine allows you to remove one or more regions from a region
selection programmatically by specifying which regions to remove.
The first argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.
If not specified, or specified as "all" or "selected", the selection is undone.
Otherwise, the result of the call will be a new selection, not containing
the unselected regions, which can be moved as one unit.

<p>
For example:
<pre>
    # select all circles and ellipses
    JS9.SelectRegions("circle || ellipse");

    # unselect circles not having tag 'foo2'
    JS9.UnselectRegions("circle && !foo2");
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.GroupRegions">Gather Regions into a Long-lived Group</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.GroupRegions(regions, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b>: which regions to group
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object containing grouping options
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>groupid</b>: the group id associated with the newly created group
</ul>

<p>
A <b>region group</b> can be moved and resized as a single unit. To
first order, it is a long-lived form of a <b>region selection</b>.
The latter gets dissolved when you click the mouse outside the
selection, but a region group is dissolved only by
calling <a href="#JS9.UngroupRegions"><b>JS9.UngroupRegions()</b></a>.

<p>
This routine allows you to create a group by specifying the regions
which will compose it.  The first argument is
the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.  If not
specified, it defaults to either "selected" or "all", depending on
whether a region selection currently exits.

<p>
The optional opts argument contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>groupid</b>: the group id to use, if possible (default: "group_[n]")
<li><b>select</b>: if false, the group is not selected upon creation
</ul>
<p>
By default, the <b>groupid</b> will be the string "group_" followed by
an integer chosen so that the groupid is unique. You can supply your
own groupid, but if it already is associated with an existing group,
an integer value will be appended to make it unique. Also, by default
the newly created group will be "selected".  You can pass
the <b>select</b> property with a value of <b>false</b> in order to
avoid selecting the group (e.g., if you are creating a number of
groups and don't want to see each of them selected in turn.)

<p>
The returned <b>groupid</b> string can be used to select and process all the
regions in that group. Thus, for example, you can use the groupid to
change the color of all grouped regions:
<pre>
    # make a group from all circles having the tag foo1
    gid = JS9.GroupRegions("circle && foo1");

    # change color of all regions in the group
    JS9.ChangeRegions(gid, {"color":"red"});
</pre>
Furthermore, when creating a regions file via
<a href="#JS9.SaveRegions"><b>JS9.SaveRegions()</b></a>, the groupid will
be stored in each grouped region's JSON object, and will be used to
reconstitute the group when the file is reloaded.

<p>
Note however, that unlike the temporary region selections,
regions in a group are not available individually,
i.e., a <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a> using a
non-groupid does not match regions inside a group. Thus, for
example, if you have created a group of circles, changing the color
using a "circle" specification does not affect circles within the group:
<pre>
    # make a group from all circles having the tag foo1
    gid = JS9.GroupRegions("circle && foo1");

    # change color of circle regions, but NOT including those in any group
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle", {"color":"cyan"});

    # change color of all regions in the group
    JS9.ChangeRegions(gid, {"color":"red"});
</pre>

<p>
Furthermore, a given region can only be part of one group at a
time. In the case where a region already is part of an existing group,
the <b>globalOpts.regGroupConflict</b> property determines how that region
is processed.  The default is <b>skip</b>, meaning that the region is
silently skipped over when creating the new group. The alternative
is <b>error</b>, which will throw an error.

<p>
To create a more temporary selection, see
<a href="#JS9.SelectRegions"><b>JS9.SelectRegions()</b></a>.

<h5 id="JS9.UngroupRegions">Dissolve a Group of Regions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.UngroupRegions(groupid, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>groupid</b>: group id of the group to dissolve
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object containing ungrouping options
</ul>

<p>
This routine allows you to dissolve an existing group, so that the
regions contained therein once again become separate.
The first argument is the <b>groupid</b>, previously returned by the
<a href="#JS9.GroupRegions"><b>JS9.GroupRegions()</b></a> call.

<p>
The optional opts argument contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>select</b>: newly separate regions in the group are "selected"?
</ul>
By default, the ungrouped regions unobtrusively take their place among
other regions on the display. You can make them be selected by
passing the <b>select: true</b> property in opts. Doing this, for
example, would allow you to remove them easily with the Delete key.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
    # group all circles and ellipses
    gid = JS9.GroupRegions("circle || ellipse");

    # ungroup so the regions are again separate
    JS9.UngroupRegions(gid)

    # change color of circle regions, including the newly ungrouped ones
    JS9.ChangeRegions("circle", {"color":"cyan"});
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.ToggleRegionTags">Toggle two region tags for the specified image(s)</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ToggleRegionTags(which, t1, t2)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>which</b>: which regions to process (default is "all")
<li><b>t1</b>: tag #1 to toggle
<li><b>t2</b>: tag #2 to toggle
</ul>
While region tags can be changed wholesale using the
<a href="#JS9.ChangeRegions"><b>JS9.ChangeRegions()</b></a> routine,
this routine allows you to toggle between two tags, e.g., a <b>source</b>
region and <b>background</b> region, or between <b>include</b> and
<b>exclude</b>. For example:
<pre>
    JS9.ToggleRegionTags("selected", "source", "background");
</pre>
will change a <b>background</b> region into a <b>source</b> region
or vice-versa, depending on the state of the region, while:
<pre>
    JS9.ToggleRegionTags("selected", "include", "exclude");
</pre>
will toggle between <b>include</b> and <b>exclude</b>.

<h5 id="JS9.LoadRegions">Load regions from a file into the current image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.LoadRegions(filename, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filename</b>: input file name or URL
<li><b>opts</b>: global region options for all regions
</ul>
Load the specified regions file into the displayed image. The filename, 
which must be specified, can be a local file (with absolute path or a
path relative to the displayed web page) or a URL.
<p>
The <b>opts</b> property specifies global options that are applied to
all regions in the file. They will be over-ridden by individual region
properties attached to a given region.  For example, if a region file
named "foo.reg" contains the following regions:
<pre>
    # Region file format: JS9 version 1.0
    image
    circle(512.0, 512.0, 40) {"color": "red"}
    box(512.0, 512.0, 40, 40)
    annulus(512.0, 512.0, 0.0, 3.0, 12.0, 18.0, 27.0)
</pre>
then a command such as:
<pre>
    JS9.LoadRegions("foo.reg", {color: "blue"});
</pre>
will create a red circle, a blue box, and a blue annulus.
<p>
The <b>opts</b> object also can include an <b>onload</b> property containing a
function to be called when the load is complete. The image handle is passed
as an argument to this function.

<p>
If the same region file is loaded more than once, behavior is
determined by the <b>JS9.globalOpts.reloadRefreshReg</b> property.
If set to <b>true</b> (the default), all previous regions loaded from
the file are removed (regardless of their current position, size,
etc.) If set to <b>false</b>, the new regions are added to the
previous ones.  Site authors can change this property in <b>js9prefs.js</b>,
while users can change this via the <b>Global</b> tab of the
<b>Preferences</b> plugin.

<p><hr>
  
<h4 id="shapes">Working with Shape Layers</h4>
  
<p>
JS9 supports individual layers for drawing 2D graphics. The ubiquitous
<a href="#regions">Regions</a> layer is a special case of a shape
layer, created automatically by JS9.  The Catalog plugin creates a
separate layer for each catalog.  You can define your own shape layer
using the <b>NewShapeLayer()</b> call and then add geometric shapes to it.

<p>
One of the most important aspects of using shapes is the ability to assign
different characteristics to shapes and then make selections based on
these characteristics. The
<b><a href="#JS9.ChangeShapes">JS9.ChangeShapes()</a></b>,
<b><a href="#JS9.GetShapes">JS9.GetShapes()</a></b>,
<b><a href="#JS9.RemoveShapes">JS9.RemoveShapes()</a></b>,
and
<b><a href="#JS9.SelectShapes">JS9.SelectShapes()</a></b>
calls all take a
<a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>
as the second argument, which functions identically to the way in which
<a href="#regions">Regions</a> selections are made.

<h5 id="JS9.NewShapeLayer">Create a new shape layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">lid = JS9.NewShapeLayer(layer, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of the layer to create
<li><b>opts</b>: default options for this layer
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>lid</b>: layer id
</ul>
This routine creates a new named shape layer. You can then, add, change,
and remove shapes in this layer using the routines below. The catalogs
displayed by the Catalog plugin are examples of separate shape layers.
<p>
The <b>opts</b> parameter allows you to specify default options for
the new layer. Although this argument is optional, you generally will
want to set default values for various properties utilized by your
new shape layer. See JS9.Regions.opts in js9.js for example of the default
options for the regions layer. This is a good set of options to pass if
you want region-like behavior in your new layer.
<p>
The JS9.Catalogs.opts object is also supplied as a possible baseline
object for new shape layers.  It differs from the JS9.Regions.opts in a
few important ways:
<ul>
<li> it makes the new layer non-interactive: individual shapes cannot be
moved, rotated, resized, or deleted, nor do they respond to events
<li> it sets the <b>updateWCS</b> property to false, so the relatively expensive operation of updating the WCS string is not performed when an object is modified
<li> it does not sort overlapping shapes so that the smallest is on top when a shape is moved
<li> it does not define regions-specific processing (e.g., double-click to edit a region parameters)
</ul>
<p>
Starting with the JS9.Catalogs.opts object as a default, you can make
the new layer interactive in a few different ways. The first way is to
set the <b>movable</b> property in the opts object to <b>true</b>.
This will permit individual shapes to be moved, rotated, resized and
deleted. Shapes also will be movable and resizable as a group.
<p>
The second way is to supply one or more event callbacks as properties
to the opts object:
<ul>
<li> <b>onmousedown</b>: function(im, xreg, evt);
<li> <b>onmouseup</b>: function(im, xreg, evt);
<li> <b>onmousemove</b>: function(im, xreg, evt);
<li> <b>onmouseover</b>: function(im, xreg, evt);
<li> <b>onmouseout</b>: function(im, xreg, evt);
</ul>
When the associated mouse event occurs on a shape, these functions
will be called with the following arguments:
<ul>
<li> <b>im</b>: the image handle for the currently displayed image
<li> <b>xreg</b>: the shape object, as described in JS9.GetShapes()
<li> <b>evt</b>: the original event object
</ul>
For example, to define mouseover and mousedown callbacks:
<pre>
    opts.onmouseover = function(im, xreg, evt){
        console.log("mouseover: %s %s", im.id, xreg.data.tag);
    };
    opts.onmousedown = function(im, xreg, evt){
        console.log("mousedown: %s %s", im.id, xreg.data.tag);
</pre>
Note that the shapes are still not movable unless you also set
the <b>movable</b> property.
<p>
In addition to firing callbacks on events for individual shapes, you
can set the <b>ongroupcreate</b> property in the opts object to a
function that will fire when two or more objects are selected into a
group (which is done using the <b>Command</b> key on a Mac,
or <b>Control</b> key everywhere else):
<ul>
<li><b>ongroupcreate</b>: function(im, xreg, evt);
</ul>
The function will be called with the following arguments:
<ul>
<li> <b>im</b>: the image handle for the currently displayed image
<li> <b>xreg</b>: an array of shape objects within the group
<li> <b>evt</b>: the original event object
</ul>
Note that an array of xreg objects is passed in this case instead of
the single "current" object passed in the other event callbacks.
For example:
<pre>
    opts.ongroupcreate = function(im, xreg, evt){
        var i, nshape, xcen, ycen;
        var xtot=0, ytot=0;
        nshape = xreg.length;
        for(i=0; i&lt;nshape; i++){
          xtot += xreg[i].x; ytot += xreg[i].y;
        }
        xcen = xtot / nshape; ycen = ytot / nshape;
        console.log("average pos for %s objects: %s,%s", nshape, xcen, ycen);
    }
</pre>
<p>
The final way to make a shape layer interactive is to specify
a <b>tooltip</b> to display when hovering over objects in this shape
layer. This is done by assigning a tooltip format string to
the <b>tooltip</b> property of the opts object.  This string can
contain HTML directives, and it also can contain references to
properties in the im, xreg, and evt objects. When the mouse hovers
over an object, a tooltip string is generated by macro-expanding the
values for these properties. The generated tooltip string is displayed
as the inner HTML of the tooltip. When the mouse leaves the object,
the tooltip is hidden.
<p>
For example, consider the following tooltip string:
<pre>
    opts.tooltip = "&lt;b&gt;id: $im.id&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;pos: $xreg.x $xreg.y&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;$xreg.data.tag&lt;/i&gt;";
</pre>
Note how properties of the <b>im</b> and <b>xreg</b> objects are
specified with a "$" prefix. When the mouse hovers over an object, the
generated tooltip will display current image id in bold, followed by
that object's x,y pixel position, followed by a user <b>tag</b>
property passed in the <b>data</b> object when the shape was added.
As a convenience, <b>$data</b> can be used as a shorthand for <b>$xreg.data</b>.

<h5 id="JS9.ShowShapeLayer">Show or hide the specified shape layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ShowShapeLayer(layer, mode)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of layer
<li><b>mode</b>: true (show layer) or false (hide layer)
</ul>
Shape layers can be hidden from display. This could be useful, for
example, if you have several catalogs loaded into a display and
want to view one at a time.
<p>
If <b>mode</b> is true, a previously hidden shape layer will be displayed. If
<b>mode</b> is false, a displayed shape layer will be hidden. If the
<b>mode</b> argument is not supplied, the current mode is returned.

<h5 id="JS9.ToggleShapeLayers">Toggle display of the active shape layers</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ToggleShapeLayers()</code>
<p>
While <a href="#JS9.ShowShapeLayer">JS9.ShowShapeLayer()</a> allows you to
display or hide a single shape layer, this routine will toggle display
of all active layers in the current image. An active layer is one that
has not been turned off using the <b>Shape Layers</b> plugin or
<a href="#JS9.ShowShapeLayer">JS9.ShowShapeLayer()</a>.

<p>
The routine remembers which layers were active at the moment when
layers are hidden and restores only those layers in the next toggle.
Thus, if you have two layers, "regions" and "catalog1", and the
"catalog1" layer has previously been turned off, calling this routine
repeatedly will turn on and off the "regions" layer only.

<h5 id="JS9.ActiveShapeLayer">Make the specified shape layer the active layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ActiveShapeLayer(layer)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of layer
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>active</b>: the active shape layer (if no args are specified)
</ul>

For a given image, one shape layer at a time is <b>active</b>,
responding to mouse and touch events. Ordinarily, a shape layer
becomes the active layer when it is first created and shapes are
added to it. Thus, the first time you create a region, the regions
layer becomes active. If you then load a catalog into a catalog layer,
that layer becomes active.

<p>
If no arguments are supplied, the <b>JS9.ActiveShapeLayer()</b>
routine returns the currently active layer. Specify the name of a
layer as the first argument to make it active. Note that the specified
layer must be visible.

<p>
This routine forms the basis for the <b>Shape Layer</b> plugin, which
provides a graphical way to make a layer active (by moving it to the
top of the layer stack.)

<h5 id="JS9.AddShapes">Add one or more shapes to the specified layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.AddShapes(layer, sarr, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of layer
<li><b>sarr</b>: a shape string, shape object, or an array of shape objects
<li><b>opts</b>: global values to apply to each created shape
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: id of last shape created
</ul>
The <b>sarr</b> argument can be a shape ("annulus", "box",
"circle", "cross", "ellipse", "point", "polygon", "text"), a single shape
object, or an array of shape objects. Shape objects contain one or
more properties, of which the most important are:
<ul>
<li><b>shape</b>: "annulus", "box", "circle", "cross", "ellipse", "point", "polygon", "text" <b>[REQUIRED]</b>
<li><b>x</b>: image x position
<li><b>y</b>: image y position
<li><b>deltax</b>: increment from current image x position
<li><b>deltay</b>: increment from current image y position
<li><b>tags</b>: comma-separated list of tag strings or array of tag strings
<li><b>radii</b>: array of radii for annulus shape
<li><b>width</b>: width for box or cross shape
<li><b>height</b>: height for box or cross shape
<li><b>radius</b>: radius value for circle shape
<li><b>r1</b>:  x radius for ellipse shape (misnomer noted)
<li><b>r2</b>:  y radius for ellipse shape (misnomer noted)
<li><b>pts</b>: array of objects containing x and y positions, for polygons
<li><b>points</b>: array of objects containing x and y offsets from the specified center, for polygons
<li><b>angle</b>: angle in degrees for box, ellipse, cross shapes
<li><b>color</b>: shape color (string name or #rrggbb syntax)
<li><b>text</b>: text associated with text shape
<li><b>data</b>: this property can be an object, string, number,
etc. and will be carried along with the shape, and returned as a
property by the
<a href="#JS9.GetShapes"><b>JS9.GetShapes()</b></a> call.
</ul>
Other available properties include:
<ul>
<li><b>changeable</b>: if false, region cannot be moved, resized, rotated
<li><b>locked</b>: 'opposite alias' of changeable
<li><b>movable</b>: if false, region cannot be moved
<li><b>resizable</b>: if false, region cannot be resized or rotated
<li><b>rotatable</b>: if false, region cannot be rotated
<li><b>removable</b>: if false, region cannot be removed
<li><b>zoomable</b>: if false, region is not resized when image is zoomed
<li><b>selectable</b>: if false, region can't be selected (no GUI-based changes)
<li><b>lockMovementX</b>: if true, region cannot be moved in the x direction
<li><b>lockMovementY</b>: if true, region cannot be moved in the y direction
<li><b>lockScalingX</b>: if true, region cannot be resized in the x direction

<li><b>fontFamily</b>: font parameter for text region
<li><b>fontSize</b>: font parameter for text region
<li><b>fontStyle</b>: font parameter for text region
<li><b>fontWeight</b>: font parameter for text region
</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.RemoveShapes">Remove one or more shapes from the specified shape layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RemoveShapes(layer, shapes)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of layer
<li><b>shapes</b>: which shapes to remove
</ul>
The selected shapes are removed from the specified layer.
The second argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions
selection</b></a>. If not specified, it defaults to "all".

<p>
If <b>JS9.globalOpts.resetEmptyShapeId</b> is set to <b>true</b> (default
is <b>false</b>), the shape id counter will be reset to 0 whenever all the
shapes are removed.

<h5 id="JS9.GetShapes">Get information about one or more shapes in the specified shape layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.GetShapes(layer, shapes)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of layer
<li><b>shapes</b>: which shapes to retrieve
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>sarr</b>: array of shape objects
</ul>
<p>
Each returned shape object contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: numeric region id (assigned by JS9 automatically)
<li><b>mode</b>: "add", "remove", or "change"
<li><b>shape</b>: region shape ("annulus", "box", "circle", "cross", "ellipse",
"point", "polygon", "text")
<li><b>tags</b>: comma delimited list of region tags (e.g., "source", "include")
<li><b>color</b>: region color

</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.ChangeShapes">Change one or more shapes in the specified layer</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ChangeShapes(layer, shapes, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of layer
<li><b>shapes</b>: which shapes to change
<li><b>opts</b>: object containing options to change in each shape
</ul>
Change one or more shapes in the specified layer. The opts object can
contain the parameters described in the
<a href="#JS9.AddShapes"><b>JS9.AddShapes()</b></a>
section. However, you cannot (yet)
change the shape itself (e.g., from "box" to "circle".)

<p>
The second argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions
selection</b></a>. If not specified, it defaults to "all".

<h5 id="JS9.CopyShapes">Copy a shape layer to another image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CopyShapes(to, layer)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>to</b>: image id to which to copy shapes
<li><b>layer</b>: shape layer to copy
</ul>
Copy the shapes in a shape layer to a different image. If <b>to</b> is
"all", then the shapes are copied to all images.
<p>
All shapes in the shape layer are copied to the new image.

<h5 id="JS9.SelectShapes">Group Shapes into a Selection</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SelectShapes(layer, shapes)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: shape layer
<li><b>shapes</b>: which shapes to select
</ul>
JS9 has a rich mouse-based interface for selecting shapes: a single
shape is selected by clicking on it. A number of shapes can be
gathered into a group selection by pressing the left mouse button and
dragging the mouse over the desired shapes. To add to an
already-existing selection, shift-click the mouse on a shape.

<p>
A selected group of regions can be moved, resized, or retrieved as a
single unit. The selected group is destroyed when the mouse is clicked
outside the selection, or when
<a href="#JS9.UnselectShapes"><b>JS9.UnselectShapes()</b></a>
is called.

<p>
This routine allows you to create a group selection programmatically by
specifying which shapes make up the selection. The first argument is the
shape layer. The second argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions
selection</b></a>.  If not specified, it defaults to "all" (since it
doesn't make sense to default to the already-selected shapes, does it?).
The result of the call will be a selected group which can be moved as one unit.

<h5 id="JS9.UnselectShapes">Remove Shapes From a Selection</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.UnselectShapes(layer, shapes)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: shape layer
<li><b>shapes</b>: which shapes to unselect
</ul>
JS9 has a rich mouse-based interface for selecting shapes: a single
shape is selected by clicking on it. A number of shapes can be
gathered into a selection by pressing the left mouse button and
dragging the mouse over the desired shapes. To add to an
already-existing selection, shift-click the mouse on a shape.

<p>
This routine allows you to remove one or more shapes from a group
selection programmatically by specifying which shapes to remove.  The
first argument is the shape layer.  The second argument is
the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.  If not
specified, or specified as "all" or "selected", the selection is
undone.  The result of the call will be a new selected group, not
containing the unselected shapes, which can be moved as one unit.

<h5 id="JS9.GroupShapes">Gather Shapes into a Long-lived Group</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.GroupShapes(layer, shapes, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: shape layer
<li><b>shapes</b>: which shapes to group
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object containing grouping options
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>groupid</b>: the group id associated with the newly created group
</ul>

<p>
A <b>shape group</b> can be moved and resized as a single unit. To
first order, it is a long-lived form of a <b>region selection</b>.
The latter gets dissolved when you click the mouse outside the
selection, but a shape group is dissolved only by
calling <b><a href="#JS9.UngroupShapes">JS9.UngroupShapes()</a></b>.

<p>
This routine allows you to create a group by specifying the shapes
which will compose it. The first argument is the shape layer.  The
second argument is the <a href="#selectregions"><b>regions selection</b></a>.
If not specified, it defaults to either "selected" or "all",
depending on whether a shape selection currently exits.

<p>
The optional opts argument contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>groupid</b>: the group id to use, if possible (default: "group_[n]")
<li><b>select</b>: if false, the group is not selected upon creation
</ul>
<p>
By default, the <b>groupid</b> will be the string "group_" followed by
an integer chosen so that the groupid is unique. You can supply your
own groupid, but if it already is associated with an existing group,
an integer value will be appended to make it unique. Also, by default
the newly created group will be "selected".  You can pass
the <b>select</b> property with a value of <b>false</b> in order to
avoid selecting the group (e.g., if you are creating a number of
groups and don't want to see each of them selected in turn.)

<p>
The returned <b>groupid</b> string can be used to select and process all the
shapes in that group. Thus, for example, you can use the groupid to
change the color of all grouped shapes:
<pre>
    # make a group from all circles having the tag foo1
    gid = JS9.GroupShapes("myregions", "circle && foo1");

    # change color of all shapes in the group
    JS9.ChangeShapes("myregions", gid, {"color":"red"});
</pre>

<p>
Note however, that unlike the temporary shape selections,
shapes in a group are not available individually,
i.e., a <a href="#selectshapes"><b>shapes selection</b></a> using a
non-groupid does not match shapes inside a group. Thus, for
example, if you have created a group of circles, changing the color
using a "circle" specification does not affect circles within the group:
<pre>
    # make a group from all circles having the tag foo1
    gid = JS9.GroupShapes("myregions", "circle && foo1");

    # change color of circle shapes, but NOT including those in any group
    JS9.ChangeShapes("myregions", "circle", {"color":"cyan"});

    # change color of all shapes in the group
    JS9.ChangeShapes("myregions", gid, {"color":"red"});
</pre>

<p>
Furthermore, a given shape can only be part of one group at a
time. In the case where a shape already is part of an existing group,
the <b>globalOpts.regGroupConflict</b> property determines how that shape
is processed.  The default is <b>skip</b>, meaning that the shape is
silently skipped over when creating the new group. The alternative
is <b>error</b>, which will throw an error.

<p>
To create a more temporary selection, see
<a href="#JS9.SelectShapes"><b>JS9.SelectShapes()</b></a>.

<h5 id="JS9.UngroupShapes">Dissolve a Group of Shapes</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.UngroupShapes(layer, groupid, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: shape layer
<li><b>groupid</b>: group id of the group to dissolve
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object containing ungrouping options
</ul>

<p>
This routine allows you to dissolve an existing group, so that the
shapes contained therein once again become separate.  The first
argument is the shape layer.  The second argument is
the <b>groupid</b>, previously returned by the
<a href="#JS9.GroupShapes"><b>JS9.GroupShapes()</b></a> call.

<p>
The optional opts argument contains the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>select</b>: newly separate shapes in the group are "selected"?
</ul>
By default, the ungrouped shapes unobtrusively take their place among
other shapes on the display. You can make them be selected by
passing the <b>select: true</b> property in opts. Doing this, for
example, would allow you to remove them easily with the Delete key.

<p>
For example:
<pre>
    # group all circles and ellipses
    gid = JS9.GroupShapes("myregions", "circle || ellipse");

    # ungroup so the shapes are again separate
    JS9.UngroupShapes("myregions", gid)

    # change color of circle shapes, including the newly ungrouped ones
    JS9.ChangeShapes("myregions", "circle", {"color":"cyan"});
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.LoadCatalog">Load an astronomical catalog</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.LoadCatalog(layer, table, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>layer</b>: name of shape layer into which to load the catalog
<li><b>table</b>: string or blob containing the catalog table, or file name
<li><b>opts</b>: catalog options
</ul>
Astronomical catalogs are a special type of JS9 shape layer, in which
the shapes have been generated from a tab-delimited text file of
columns, including two columns that contain RA and Dec values. An
astronomical catalog can have a pre-amble of comments, which, by
default, have a '#' character in the first column.

<p>
Two examples of catalog files are shown below:

Notice that both files have a tab-delimited header, followed by a
tab-delimited line of dashes, followed by tab-delimited data rows. This file 
format is sometimes called "tsv"  or "tab-separated values". A very useful
astronomical package for manipulating tables is
<a href="http://hopper.si.edu/wiki/mmti/Starbase" target="_blank">Starbase</a>,
written by John Roll.

<p>
The <b>JS9.LoadCatalog()</b> routine will read a file in this format,
processing the data rows by converting the RA and Dec values into
image position values that will be displayed as shapes in a new
catalog layer.

<p>
The first argument to the <b>JS9.LoadCatalog()</b> routine is the name
of the shape layer that will contain the objects in the catalog. Specifying
the name of an existing layer is valid: previous shapes in that layer will
be removed.

<p>
The second argument is either a blob or a string containing the table
data described above. Blobs are the result of loading a local file
into the browser (e.g., the <b>load catalog</b> menu option), while
strings result from a remote XHR call (e.g., the <b>Archives and
Catalogs</b> plugin.)  Alternatively, the second string argument can
be a file name or URL to load. File names are distinguished from
strings containing a table in that the latter must contain at least one
tab.

<p>
The third argument is an optional object used to specify parameters, including:
<ul>
<li><b>xcol</b>: name of the RA column in the table (default is a heuristic, see below)
<li><b>ycol</b>: name of the Dec column in the table (default is a heuristic, see below)
<li><b>wcssys</b>: WCS system (FK4, FK5, ICRS, galactic, ecliptic) (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>shape</b>: shape of catalog object (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>color</b>: color of catalog shapes (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>width</b>: width of box catalog shapes (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>height</b>: height of box catalog shapes (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>radius</b>: radius of circle catalog shapes (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>r1</b>: r1 of ellipse catalog shapes (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>r2</b>: r2 of ellipse catalog shapes (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>save</b>: save the catalog properties for each generated shape (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>tooltip</b>: format of tooltip string to display for each object (default is from globalOpts)
<li><b>skip</b>: comment character in table file  (default is from globalOpts)
</ul>
Most of these properties have default values that are stored in
the <b>JS9.globalOpts.catalogs</b> object: manipulate that object as
needed. The values listed above also can be changed by users via
the <b>Catalog</b> tab in the <b>Preferences</b> plugin.

<p>
The <b>opts</b> object also can include an <b>onload</b> property containing a
function to be called when the load is complete. The image handle is passed
as an argument to this function.

<p>
Note the second (Vizier) example table above does not actually have a columns
called "RA" and "Dec".  Instead, it has "_RAJ2000", "_DEJ2000", "RAJ2000",
and "DEJ2000" columns. In order to pick RA and Dec column, a heuristic is used
based on the values contained in the <b>JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.ras</b> and
<b>JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.decs</b> arrays:
<ul>
<li> the <b>opts.xcol</b>, if defined, specifies the RA column (similarly for opts.ycol and the Dec column)
<li> otherwise try to match exactly the catalog header against all the array elements in JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.ras to get the RA column (same for catalogs.decs)
<li> if no exact match, try a case-insensitive match of the catalog columns against a regular expression that begins with the first array element in JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.ras (e.g., "RA*")
<li> if no approximate match, try a case-insensitive match of the catalog columns against a regular expression containing the first array element in JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.ras (e.g., "*RA*")
</ul>
The default global JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.ras contains:
<pre>
  ras:  ["RA", "_RAJ2000", "RAJ2000"]
  decs: ["Dec", "_DEJ2000", "DEJ2000"]
</pre>
These defaults make it easy to process simple catalogs and Vizier
catalogs.

<p>
Once the RA and Dec columns are specified, the RA and Dec values from
each row are converted into image positions, and JS9 shapes are
generated to be displayed in the new catalog layer. The WCS system
used to convert RA and Dec into image coordinates can be specified
using the <b>opts.wcssys</b> or <b>JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.wcssys</b>
properties.

<p>
The RA and Dec of the catalog object are always saved in the data
object of each generated shape, for use in the tooltip string. In
addition, if opts.save (or the default: JS9.globalOpts.catalogs.save)
property is not false, all of the catalog object properties will also be
save in the data object for use in the tooltip string, e.g.:
<pre>
  opts.tooltip = "$xreg.data.ra $xreg.data.dec $xreg.data.Qflg $xreg.data.Rflg"
</pre>
in the above VizieR example. Caveat: any "." (dot) in any catalog property
name will be converted to "_" (underscore) automatically. For a more detailed
discussion of tooltips, please see
<a href="#JS9.NewShapeLayer"><b>JS9.NewShapeLayer()</b></a>.

<p>
When catalog layer has been created, you can use the <b>Shape Layers</b>
plugin to toggle its visibility and also to change its position in the layer
stack.

<h5 id="JS9.SaveCatalog">Save an astronomical catalog to a file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SaveCatalog(filename, which)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filename</b>: output file name
<li><b>which</b>: layer containing catalog objects to save
</ul>
Save the specified catalog-containing layer as a text file. If filename is not
specified, the file will be saved as [layer].cat.

<p>
Don't forget that the file is saved by the browser, in whatever location
you have set up for downloads.

<p>
If the <b>which</b> argument is not specified, the catalog associated
with the current active layer will be saved. In either case, the
layer to save must actually be a catalog created from a tab-delimited
file (or URL) of catalog objects (not, for example, the regions layer.)

<p><hr>
  
<h4 id="gestures">Mouse/Touch Gestures</h4>

<p>
JS9 supports the following configurable mouse and touch actions:
<ul>
<li> mouse movement with no buttons pressed
<li> mouse movement with one button pressed
<li> mouse movement with two buttons pressed
<li> touch with one finger
<li> touch with two fingers
<li> touch with three fingers
</ul>
The initial actions are defined by the <b>JS9.globalOpts.mouseActions</b>
and <b>JS9.globalOpts.touchActions</b> arrays. In addition, the
<b>JS9.globalOpts.mousetouchZoom</b> property specifies whether a mouse wheel
or touch/pinch will zoom the image. The default actions are:
<ul>
<li> <b>mouseActions:</b> ["display value/position", "change contrast/bias", "pan the image"]
<li> <b>touchActions:</b> ["display value/position", "change contrast/bias", "pan the image"]
<li> <b>mousetouchZoom:</b> false
</ul>
where the array elements map to an increasing numbers of
buttons/fingers.  You can change the default actions of the elements
in either array in your js9Prefs.json file. For example, to make pan
and zoom the default one-touch and pinch actions respectively:
<ul>
<li> <b>touchActions:</b> ["pan the image", "display value/position", "change contrast/bias"]
<li> <b>mousetouchZoom:</b> true
</ul>
As usual, the defaults in js9Prefs.json are used by all JS9 displays in
a web page.

<p>
Users can change the action assignments using the <b>MouseTouch</b>
plugin, which displays the current mapping between mouse/touch gesture
and its action. Simply drag and drop an action to a different gesture
in order to change the mapping. You also can toggle the scroll/pinch
to zoom capability by clicking its button.

<p>
Web page developers can extend the available mouse and touch actions
beyond the defaults contained in
<a href="../plugins/core/mousetouch.js">the Mouse Touch plugin</a>. To
add a new action, first write a function with the following calling sequence:
<pre>
    gestureFunc(im, ipos, evt)
</pre>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>im</b>: image handle
<li><b>ipos</b>: image position object containing 1-indexed x and y image
coordinate values
<li><b>evt</b>: a JavaScript or jQuery event
</ul>
Add this new function to the JS9.MouseTouchActions array, using a
descriptive name as its array index, e.g.:
<pre>
    JS9.MouseTouch.Actions["all contrast/bias"] = function(im, ipos, evt){
      var i, myim;
      for(i=0; i&lt;JS9.displays.length; i++){
        myim = JS9.displays[i].image;
        if( myim ){
          JS9.MouseTouch.Actions["change contrast/bias"](myim, ipos, evt);
        }
      }
    };
</pre>
At this point, the <b>Mouse Touch Plugin</b> will display the new
function in its list of available actions. Users can move it into one
of the defined gestures to activate it.

<p>
Of course, you can add the new action to the JS9.globalOpts.mouseActions
and/or JS9.globalOpts.touchActions arrays to make it active immediately:
<pre>
    JS9.globalOpts.mouseActions[1] = "all contrast/bias";
    JS9.globalOpts.touchActions[1] = "all contrast/bias";
</pre>
Here, we have replaced the one-button mouse move and two-button touch
move actions (whose defaults are to "change contrast/bias") with our
new action.

<h4 id="server">Server-side Analysis</h4>

<h5 id="JS9.GetAnalysis">Get server-side analysis task definitions</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.GetAnalysis()</code>
<p>
The <b>JS9.GetAnalysis()</b> routine returns an array of analysis task
definitions, each containing the following information:
<ul>
<li><b>name:</b> a short identifier string (typically one word)
<li><b>title:</b> a longer string that will be displayed in the Analysis menu
<li><b>files:</b> a rule that will be matched against to determine
whether this task is available for the current image
<li><b>purl:</b> a URL pointing to a web page containing a user parameter form
<li><b>action:</b> the command to execute on the server side
<li><b>rtype:</b> a return type, which can be <b>text</b>, <b>plot</b>, <b>fits</b>, <b>regions</b>, <b>catalog</b>, <b>alert</b>, or <b>none</b>
<li><b>hidden:</b> if true, the analysis task is not shown in the Analysis menu
</ul>
Not every property listed above will be present in every task definition
(e.g., <b>purl</b> is only present when there is a parameter form.)
Also note that hidden tasks are not returned by this call.

<h5 id="JS9.RunAnalysis">Run a server-side analysis task</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RunAnalysis(name, parr, func)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b>: name of analysis tool
<li><b>parr</b>: optional array of macro-expansion options for command line
<li><b>func</b>: optional routine to call when analysis is completed on server
</ul>
The <b>JS9.RunAnalysis()</b> routine is used to execute a server-side
analysis task and return the results for further processing within the
web page.
The optional <b>parr</b> array of parameters is passed to the JS9
analysis macro expander so that values can be added to the command
line.  The array is in jQuery name/value serialized object format,
which is described here:
<pre>
    http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
</pre>
<p>
The <b>func()</b> routine is a callback function to process the returned
results from the analysis task.  The calling sequence is:
<pre>
    func(stdout, stderr, errcode, aobj)
</pre>
where:
<ul>
<li> <b>stdout</b>: a string containing the standard output from the task
<li> <b>stderr</b>: a string containing the standard error from the task
<li> <b>errcode</b>: error code value from the task or 0
<li> <b>aobj</b>: the analysis object from the js9Analysis.json file,
     containing, among other things, the important <b>rtype</b>:
     "text" or "plot"
</ul>
Typically, you would check stderr string first and issue an error
message if there is an error. Otherwise, the stdout string can be
processed based on the return type (rtype) property of the output
(e.g., "text" or "plot".) For plotting, you can use <b>flot</b>
functionality already loaded into JS9, or you can use your own chosen
plotting package.
<p>
If no <b>func</b> callback is specified, the default processing will
display "text" in a new light window.  If the return type is "plot",
the results are assumed to be in <b>flot</b> format and will be plotted.
<p>
Instead of passing a callback function each time, you can set the global
property <b>JS9.globalOpts.analysisFunc</b> to a function having the
same signature:
<pre>
    func(stdout, stderr, errcode, aobj)
</pre>
The specified function will be called for each execution
of <b>JS9.RunAnalysis</b>
<p>
In addition, you can change the target of the analysis results display
from a light window to your own div element by setting the global
property <b>JS9.globalOpts.analysisDiv</b> to the id of your new
target div. The div must have CSS height and width properties if you
are going to plot results.

<h5 id="JS9.SubmitAnalysis">Run a server-side analysis task, utilizing
parameters in a form</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SubmitAnalysis(el, name, func)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>el</b>: form element (unused at present)
<li><b>name</b>: name of analysis tool
<li><b>func</b>: optional routine to call when analysis is completed on server
</ul>
The <b>JS9.SubmitAnalysis()</b> routine is used to run an analysis
task with input parameters from a form. Typically used as
the <b>Run</b> button action in a form, it automatically serializes
the form values and passes them to the JS9 analysis macro expander so
that these values can be integrated into the analysis command line.
See js9analysis.html for a simple example.
<p>
The <b>func</b> callback and global options are the same as
for
<a href="#JS9.RunAnalysis"><b>JS9.RunAnalysis()</b></a>
above.

<h4 id="displays">Working with Displays</h4>

<h5 id="JS9.DisplayNextImage">Display the Next (or Previous) Image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9DisplayNextImage(n)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>n</b>: number of images beyond (or prior to) the one currently displayed
</ul>
The <b>JS9.DisplayNextImage()</b> routine displays the nth image in
the display's image list beyond the currently displayed image. The
default value for n is 1. You can supply a negative number to
display an image prior to the current one in the display's image list.

<h5 id="JS9.CreateMosaic">Create a Mosaic Image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CreateMosaic(which, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>which</b>: which images to use in the mosaic
<li><b>opts</b>: mosaic options
</ul>

The <b>JS9.CreateMosaic()</b> creates a mosaic image from the
specified (previously-loaded) FITS images using the
<a href="http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/mProjectPP.html" target="_blank">mProjectPP</a>
and
<a href="http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/mAdd.html" target="_blank">mAdd</a>
programs from the
<a href="http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Montage</a> software suite.
These Montage programs have been compiled into JS9 using
<a href="https://emscripten.org/" target="_blank">Emscripten</a>.

<p>
Because the browser environment is memory-limited, there are some
restrictions on generating mosaics in JS9. The FITS files must be
well-behaved, i.e., they must have WCS projections which can be
approximated by tangent-plane projections (TAN, SIN, ZEA, STG, ARC.)
This precludes creating mosaics from images covering large portions of
the sky. For large sky areas, please use Montage itself on your desktop
to create a mosaic. A simplified js9mosaic script is included in
the JS9 distribution or, for more control, use the Montage programs
directly. Of course, in either case, you must install Montage.

<p>
The <b>which</b> parameter determine which images are used in the mosaic:
<ul>
<li><b>"current" or null</b>: the current image in this display
<li><b>"all"</b>: all images in this display
<li><b>im</b>: the image id or image handle of an image from any display
<li><b>[im1, im2, ...]</b>: an array of image ids or handles from any display
</ul>
In general, use "current" (or null) if you have loaded a multi-extension
FITS mosaic (e.g., a CFHT FITS file) into JS9. Use "all" if you have loaded
several FITS files into JS9 and want to create a mosaic.

<p>
In order to keep the size of the resulting mosaic within memory
limits, JS9 reduces the size of each image before adding them all
together The <b>options</b> parameter determines how the reduction is
performed:
<ul>
<li><b>dim</b>: size of mosaic (def: max of JS9.globalOpts.image.[xdim,ydim])
<li><b>reduce</b>: image size reduction technique: "js9" (def) or "shrink"
<li><b>verbose</b>: if true, processing output is sent to the javascript console
</ul>
The "dim" parameter is a target size: the larger of the resulting
mosaic dimensions will be approximately this value, depending on how
Montage processes the images. The "reduce" technique either runs
internal JS9 image sectioning code (to produce smaller internal
images, each of which are reprojected and added together) or runs the
Montage mShrinkHdr code (which reprojects the full images into smaller
files.) The former seems to be faster than the latter in most
cases. The "verbose" parameter will display output on the JavaScript
console to let you know that the CreateMosaic() call is running properly.

<p>
The resulting mosaic will be loaded into the specified JS9 display as
a separate image. Because the mosaic is separate from the original
image(s), you can view each of the latter individually (or view each
image extension of a single image using the <b>Extensions</b> plugin.)
Internal analysis can be performed on the mosaic (e.g., ImExam functions)
but, of course, no external analysis tasks will be available.

<h5 id="JS9.LookupDisplay">Lookup a JS9 display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">dobj = JS9.LookupDisplay(dname, mustExist)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: name of JS9 display to look up
<li><b>mustExist</b>: whether to throw error if a dname display does not exist
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>dobj</b>: the JS9 display object
</ul>
The <b>JS9.LookupDisplay()</b> routine returns the display object associated
with the specified <b>dname</b> parameter. If no <b>dname</b> is specified,
the first available display is returned.
<p>
If <b>dname</b> is specified but does not exist, an error is thrown unless
the <b>mustExist</b> parameter is explicitly set to false (i.e., the default
is that the id must exist.)

<h5 id="JS9.ResizeDisplay">Resize the JS9 Display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.ResizeDisplay(dname, width, height, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: optional name of JS9 display to resize
<li><b>width</b>: new width of the display in HTML pixels (or "full" or "reset")
<li><b>height</b>: new height of the display in HTML pixels
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object containing resize parameters
</ul>
You can resize the JS9 display by supplying new width and
height parameters. The div on the web page will be resized and the
image will be re-centered in the new display. If the display size has
been increased, more of the image will be displayed as needed (up to
the new size of the display.) For example, if the original display was
512x512 and you increase it to 1024x1024, a 1024x1024 image will now
be displayed in its entirety.

<p>
If the first argument is <b>full</b>, the display is resized to match
the browser window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight variables, which
are the width and height (in pixels) of the browser window
viewport. You can then scroll the window so that the image fills the
entire browser window.  Alternatively, if the first argument
is <b>reset</b>, the display is resized to match its original size.

<p>
The opts object can contain the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>resizeMenubar</b>: change the width of the menubar as well
</ul>
The default for <b>resizeMenubar</b> is <b>true</b>, so you only need
to pass this property if you do not want to perform the resize.
<p>
If no arguments are passed to this routine, it returns an object
containing the current display width and height. Otherwise, the
display object is returned.
<p>
You can supply a display name as the first argument, or the display object:
<pre>
    JS9.ResizeDisplay("myJS9", 350, 400);
</pre>
or:
<pre>
    JS9.ResizeDisplay(350, 400, {display: "myJS9"});
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.MoveToDisplay">Move an image to a new JS9 display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.MoveToDisplay(dname)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: name of JS9 display to which the image will be moved
</ul>
The <b>JS9.MoveToDisplay()</b> routine moves the current image to the
specified display:
<pre>
    JS9.MoveToDisplay("myJS9", {display: "JS9"});
</pre>
will move the current image displayed in the "JS9" display window to
the "myJS9" window. 
<p>
Note that the new JS9 display must already exist. New displays can be
created with the
<a href="#JS9.LoadWindow"><b>JS9.LoadWindow()</b></a>
public access routine or
the <b>File:new JS9 light window</b> menu option.

<h5 id="JS9.GatherDisplay">Gather other images to this JS9 Display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.GatherDisplay(dname, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: name of JS9 display to which the images will be gathered
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object
</ul>
<p>
This routine move all images in other displays to this display. 
You can supply a display name or the display object:
<pre>
    JS9.GatherDisplay("myJS9");
</pre>
or:
<pre>
    JS9.GatherDisplay({display: "myJS9"});
</pre>
You can supply an opts object containing the properties:
<ul>
<li><b>images</b>: array of image handles (or indexes into JS9.images array) to gather
</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.SeparateDisplay">Separate images in this JS9 Display into new displays</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SeparateDisplay(dname, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: name of JS9 display from which the images will be separated
<li><b>opts</b>: optional object for layout properties
</ul>
This routine moves each image in the specified display to a new display.
You can supply a display name or the display object:
<pre>
    JS9.SeparateDisplay("myJS9");
</pre>
or:
<pre>
    JS9.SeparateDisplay({display: "myJS9"});
</pre>
You also can supply an opts object containing the properties:
<ul>
<li><b>images</b>: array of image handles (or indexes into JS9.images array) to separate
<li><b>layout</b>: can be "horizontal", "vertical", "auto" (default: "auto")
<li><b>leftMargin</b>: margin in pixels between horizontally separated images
<li><b>topMargin</b>: margin in pixels between vertically separated images
<li><b>idbase</b>: base string for ids of separated displays
</ul>
By default, the new displays are all placed in light windows, whose
positions can be adjusted on the screen as needed.  The "horizontal"
layout will generate a single row of images. The "vertical" layout
will generate a single column of images.  The "auto" option will
layout the images in one or more rows. Each row will contain one or
more images such that at least one-half of the right-most image is
visible in the browser without the need for horizontal scrolling.
<p>
Note that you can supply the opts object without supplying the display
parameter, e.g:
<pre>
    JS9.SeparateDisplay({layout: "horizontal"});
</pre>
will separate images from the default "JS9" display in a horizontal layout.
<p>
By default, the ids of the successive JS9 displays will consist of
the original display id, followed by the string "_sep", followed by an
increasing integer (not necessarily starting at 1.) If you pass
the <b>idbase</b> property in the opts object, the id of each successive
display will be the specified base id followed by an increasing integer
that does start from 1. In the latter case, it is your responsibility to
ensure that the new ids to not conflict with existing ids.

<p>
Instead of light windows to hold the new displays, you can also use the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS Grid Layout</a> to automatically position the new displays in
ordinary div elements. To do this, the layout is set to "auto" and the initial
display (along with its menubar, colorbar, statusbar) is wrapped in two divs:
<ul>
<li> an outer div of class <b>JS9GridContainer</b>
<li> an inner div of class <b>JS9GridItem</b>
</ul>
If a browser supports CSS Grid Layout (most do as of 2017), a grid layout
will be used. Otherwise, light windows will be used. For example:
<pre>
    &lt;div class="JS9GridContainer"&gt;
    &lt;div class="JS9GridItem"&gt;
        &lt;div class="JS9Menubar" id="JS9Menubar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="JS9" id="JS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="JS9Statusbar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
The outer <b>JS9GridContainer</b> div is associated with the CSS
Grid container (i.e. its <b>display</b> property is set to <b>grid</b>.)
The inner <b>JS9GridItem</b> div delineates the contents of the "item" that
will added to the container when the displays are separated.

<p>
You can tailor the layout by adding Grid Layout CSS directives to
<b>JS9GridContainer</b>. In particular, style elements such as
<b>grid-template-columns</b> and <b>grid-gap</b> are applied to this div:
<pre>
      div.JS9GridContainer {
	  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
	  grid-gap: 10px;
      }
</pre>
See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS Grid Layout</a> for more information about CSS Grids.

<h5 id="JS9.CenterDisplay">Scroll the JS9 display to the center of the viewport</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CenterDisplay(dname)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: name of JS9 display to center
</ul>
<p>
This routine scrolls this display to the center of the viewport.
You can supply a display name or the display object:
<pre>
    JS9.CenterDisplay("myJS9");
</pre>
or:
<pre>
    JS9.CenterDisplay({display: "myJS9"});
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.RenameDisplay">Rename the id of a JS9 display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RenameDisplay(oid, nid)</code>
<p>
Calling sequences:
<pre>
    JS9.RenameDisplay(nid)        # change default id (usually "JS9") to nid
    JS9.RenameDisplay(oid, nid)   # change oid to nid
</pre>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>oid</b>: old name of JS9 display
<li><b>nid</b>: new name of JS9 display
</ul>
<p>
This routine is used by the Desktop version of JS9 to implement the
<b>--title</b> (and <b>--renameid</b>) switch(es), which change the id
of the JS9 display(s) to the specified id(s). Once an id has been
renamed, external communication (via the js9 script or pyjs9) should
target the new id instead of the original id.
<p>
The original id is still available internally, so Javascript public
API calls on the web page itself can target either the original or the
new id using the {display: "id"} syntax.

<h5 id="JS9.CloseDisplay">Close all images in a display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.CloseDisplay(dname, regexp)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: name of JS9 display whose images will be closed
<li><b>regexp</b>: optional regular expression to specify which images to close
</ul>
<p>
By default, his routine closes all images in the specified display.
You can supply a display name as the first argument or the display object:
<pre>
    JS9.CloseDisplay("myJS9");
</pre>
or:
<pre>
    JS9.CloseDisplay({display: "myJS9"});
</pre>
If a regular expression is specified as second argument, only images matching
that regular expression will be closed. For example:
<pre>
  JS9.CloseDisplay("JS9", ".*mask.fits.gz");
</pre>
will close all mask files. As a convenience, you can omit the display argument
and specify the template as the first argument:
<pre>
  JS9.CloseDisplay(".*mask.fits.gz");
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.RemoveDisplay">Close all images in a display and remove the display</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.RemoveDisplay(dname)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dname</b>: name of JS9 display to remove
</ul>
This routine will close all images in the specified display and then
remove the display. It is available for displays contained in
light windows and for displays contained in JS9 Grid Containers. When
removing the display inside a light window, the light window is
immediately closed without a confirmation dialog box (unlike a light
window being closed via its <b>close</b> button.) For a display inside
a JS9 Grid Container, the display is removed from the DOM, so that it
no longer is part of the grid layout. Note, however, that you cannot
remove all displays from a grid container: at least one display must be
left in the container.

<h4 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h4>

<h5 id="JS9.Print">Print an image</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.Print(opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>opts</b>: options for print
</ul>
<p>
Print the currently displayed image. A new window is displayed
containing the image, along with regions and other graphical layers
(the 2D graphics having been converted to a re-scalable format.)  The
standard Print dialog box also is displayed and can be used to print
this new window.  Dismiss both windows when you are finished.

<p>
By default, if a colorbar is active on the page, it will be placed
beneath the image. You can pass the <b>colorbar: false</b> option
in the <b>opts</b> object to avoid printing the active colorbar.

<h5 id="JS9.WindowPrint">Print the desktop window (<b>desktop app only</b>)</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.WindowPrint(opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>opts</b>: options for print
</ul>
<p>
The JS9 desktop application that utilizes 
<a href="https://electronjs.org" target="_blank">Electron.js</a> has the ability to
print the whole application window. When executed, the system print
dialog box is displayed (unless the <b>silent</b> the option is passed in
opts) and the window will be printed according to your print configuration.
<p>
The first argument allows you to specify the following options:
<ul>
<li><b>silent</b>: don't ask user for print settings (def: false)
<li><b>printBackground</b>: prints the background color and image of the web page (def: true)
<li><b>deviceName</b>: set the printer device name to use (def: "")
</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.WindowToPDF">Save the desktop window to a PDF file (<b>desktop app only</b>)</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.WindowToPDF(filename, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filename</b>: PDF file name
<li><b>opts</b>: options for save
</ul>
<p>
The JS9 desktop application that utilizes 
<a href="https://electronjs.org" target="_blank">Electron.js</a> has the ability to
save the whole application window to a PDF file. The first argument specifies
the name of the PDF file.
<p>
The second argument allows you to specify the following options:
<ul>
<li><b>marginsType</b>: the type of margins to use: 0 for default margin, 1 for no margin, and 2 for minimum margin
<li><b>pageSize</b>: page size of the generated PDF: A3, A4, A5, Legal, Letter, Tabloid (NB: might not work with all printers)
<li><b>printBackground</b>: prints the background color and image of the web page (def: true)
<li><b>printSelectionOnly</b>: whether to print selection only (<b>NB: This seems to crash the application!</b>)
<li><b>landscape</b>: true for landscape, false for portrait
</ul>

<h5 id="JS9.SaveDir">Set the save directory for downloads (<b>desktop app only</b>)</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SaveDir(dirname)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>dirname</b>: directory name for downloads
</ul>
The JS9 desktop application that utilizes 
<a href="https://electronjs.org" target="_blank">Electron.js</a> has the ability to
specify a directory into which files will be saved (e.g., by routines such 
<a href="#JS9.SavePNG">JS9.SavePNG()</a>)
without using a dialog box. This is especially useful in scripts.

<p>
The savedir directory can be specified on the desktop command line using the
--savedir switch:
<pre>
    js9 -a --savedir $HOME/tmp ~/data/casa.fits
</pre>
But you can use this routine to set or change the save directory at any time:
<pre>
    js9 SaveDir "$HOME/tmp"
</pre>
Future downloads for this desktop session will then be saved (without
use of a dialog box) to the specified directory.

<p>
It's worth remembering that relative paths are taken relative to the
directory in which the JS9 app was started, not the current directory in which
you are running the js9 SaveDir command. To avoid confusion, it is recommended
that you supply a full path.

<h5 id="JS9.SaveFITS">Save image as a FITS file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SaveFITS(filename, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filename</b>: output file name
<li><b>opts</b>: optional opts or "display"
</ul>
Save the currently displayed image as a FITS file. If filename is not
specified, the file will be saved as "js9.fits".
<p>
If a second argument is supplied, it can be the string "display" or an
object containing the property "source". If "display" or opts.source
is "display" is passed, the currently displayed image section is
saved. Otherwise, the full image (or extracted image section, if
appropriate) is saved.
<p>
Don't forget that the file is saved by the browser, in whatever location
you have set up for downloads.

<h5 id="JS9.SavePNG">Save image as a PNG file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SavePNG(filename, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filename</b>: output file name
<li><b>opts</b>: optional save parameters
</ul>
Save the currently displayed image as a PNG file. If filename is not
specified, the file will be saved as "js9.png". The image is saved
along with the graphical overlays (regions, etc..)

<p>
The opts object can specify the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>layers</b>: save graphical layers (e.g., regions) (default is true)
<li><b>source</b>: "image" or "display" (default is "display")
</ul>
By default, <b>SavePNG()</b> will save all of the 2D graphics in the
shape layers (regions, catalogs, etc.) as well as the image. Set
the <b>layers</b> property to false to save only the image.

<p>
Also by default, <b>SavePNG()</b> will save the RGB pixels from the
display. This means, for example, that a blended set of images will
save the blended pixels. If you want to save the RGB pixels from one
of the images in a blended image, you can specify the <b>source</b>
property to the <b>image</b>. For example, in the js9blend.html demo,
you can save the RGB pixels of the Chandra image by specifying use of
the "image" source and specifying the image's id in the <b>display</b>
parameter:
<pre>
    JS9.SavePNG("chandra.png", {source:"image"}, {display:"chandra.fits"});
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget that the file is saved by the browser, in whatever location
you have set up for downloads.

<h5 id="JS9.SaveJPEG">Save image as a JPEG file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SaveJPEG(filename, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>filename</b>: output file name
<li><b>opts</b>: optional save parameters or a number between 0 and 1 indicating image quality
</ul>
Save the currently displayed image as a JPEG file. If filename is not
specified, the file will be saved as "js9.jpeg". The image is saved
along with the graphical overlays (regions, etc..)

<p>
The opts object can specify the following properties:
<ul>
<li><b>layers</b>: save graphical layers (e.g., regions) (default is true)
<li><b>source</b>: "image" or "display" (default is "display")
<li><b>quality</b>: JPEG encoder quality
</ul>
By default, <b>SaveJPEG()</b> will save all of the 2D graphics in the
shape layers (regions, catalogs, etc.) as well as the image. Set
the <b>layers</b> property to false to save only the image.

<p>
Also by default, <b>SaveJPEG()</b> will save the RGB pixels from the
display. This means, for example, that a blended set of images will
save the blended pixels. If you want to save the RGB pixels from one
of the images in a blended image, you can specify the <b>source</b>
property to the <b>image</b>. For example, in the js9blend.html demo,
you can save the RGB pixels of the Chandra image by specifying use of
the "image" source and specifying the image's id in the <b>display</b>
parameter:
<pre>
    JS9.SaveJPEG("chandra.png", {source:"image"}, {display:"chandra.fits"});
</pre>

<p>
If encoder quality parameter is not specified, a suitable default is
used. On FireFox (at least), this default values is 0.95 (I think.)

<p>
Don't forget that the file is saved by the browser, in whatever location
you have set up for downloads.

<h5 id="JS9.UploadFITSFile">Upload currently displayed FITS file to proxy server</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.UploadFITSFile()</code>
<p>
Upload the currently displayed FITS file to the proxy server, so that
back-end analysis can be performed. This routine requires that a Node.js-based
JS9 helper is running and that the helper has enabled the <b>loadProxy</b>
property and set up a <b>workDir</b> directory in which to store the FITS file.

<h5 id="JS9.GetFITSHeader">Get FITS header as a string</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.GetFITSHeader(nlflag)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>nlflag</b>: true if newlines should added to each card
</ul>
Return the FITS header as a string. By default, the returned string contains
the 80-character FITS cards all concatenated together. If <b>nlflag</b>
is <b>true</b>, each card will have a new-line appended.
<p>
Note that the
<a href="#JS9.GetImageData"><b>JS9.GetImageData()</b></a>
routine also returns the
FITS header, but as an object whose properties contain the header
values. For example, obj.SIMPLE will usually have a value of true,
obj.BITPIX will have contain the bits/pixel, etc. This object is more
useful for programming tasks, but does not contain the FITS comments
associated with each header card.

<h5 id="JS9.DisplayHelp">Display help in a light window</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplayHelp(name)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b>: name of a help file or url of a web site to display
</ul>
The help file names are the property names in JS9.helpOpts (e.g., "user" for
the user page, "install" for the install page, etc.) Alternatively, you can
specify an arbitrary URL to display (just because.)

<h5 id="JS9.DisplayPlugin">Display plugin in a light window</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.DisplayPlugin(name)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b>: name of the plugin
</ul>
Toggle the light-window display of the named plugin, as is done by
the <b>View</b> and <b>Analysis</b> menus. That is, if the plugin is
not visible, make it visible. If the plugin is visible, hide it. 
<p>
You can supply the full class and plugin name or just the name, using
exact case or lower case, e.g.:
<ul>
<li> JS9Panner or panner
<li> JS9Magnifier or magnifier
<li> JS9Info or info
<li> JS9Console or console
<li> DataSourcesArchivesCatalogs or archivescatalogs
<li> FitsBinning or binning
<li> ImExamEncEnergy or encenergy
<li> ImExamPxTabl or pxtabl
<li> ImExamRadialProj or radialproj
<li> ImExamHistogram or histogram
<li> ImExamRegionStats or regionstats
<li> ImExamXProj or xproj
<li> ImExamYProj or yproj
<li> ImExam3dPlot or 3dplot
<li> ImExamContours or contours
</ul>
<p>
As with plugins in the View and Analysis menus, this routine does
nothing if the plugin is explicitly defined on the web page.
<p>
This routine is useful if you are building a web interface that
supports the JS9 menu functions.

<h5 id="JS9.LightWindow">Display content in a light window</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.LightWindow(id, type, content, title, opts)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>id</b>: unique id for light window div(default: "lightWindow" + uniqueID)
<li><b>type</b>: content type: "inline", "div", "ajax", "iframe" (default: "inline")
<li><b>content</b>: content of the light window (default: none)
<li><b>title</b>: title (default: "JS9 light window")
<li><b>opts</b>: configuration string (default: "width=830px,height=400px,center=1,resize=1,scrolling=1")
</ul>
Display arbitrary content inside a light window. There are any number
of light window routines available on the Net. JS9 uses light window
routines developed by Dynamic Drive (http://www.dynamicdrive.com).
Their extensive documentation can be found
<a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex8/dhtmlwindow/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
The content shown inside the window depends on the <b>content</b> parameter:
<ul>
<li> <b>iframe</b>: the URL of the page to display (ie: "http://www.google.com")
<li><b>inline</b>: the HTML to display (back-slashing any special JavaScript characters, such as apostrophes)
<li><b>ajax</b>: the relative path to the external page to display, relative to the current page (ie: "../external.htm")
<li><b>div</b>: define a DIV element on the page with a unique ID attribute (probably hidden using style="display:none") and the use the DIV's id as the content value
</ul>
JS9 typically uses the <b>inline</b> option. Note that web sites often
do not allow themselves to be embedded in an iframe, so this is an
unreliable option.

<p>
The <b>opts</b> parameter specifies options for the light window, such
as its size.  This parameter consists of a string with comma-separated
keywords, e.g.:
<pre>
    "width=830px,height=400px,center=1,resize=1,scrolling=1"
</pre>
The opts keywords, defined in the Dynamic Drive documentation, are:
width, height, left, top, center, resize, and scrolling.  The
JS9.lightOpts.dhtml object defines oft-used lightwin configurations,
and the JS9.lightOpts.dhtml.textWin property is used as the
default for this call. You can utilize these properties in your own call
to <b>JS9.LightWindow()</b> or make up your own configuration string.

<p>
As an extension to the Dynamic Drive light window support, JS9 adds the ability
to double-click the title bar in order to close the window.

<h5 id="JS9.OpenFileMenu">Use the file dialog box to load a FITS file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.OpenFileMenu()</code>
<p>
Calling this routine brings up the browser's file dialog box. When a
FITS file is selected, if will be loaded into the JS9 display.
<p>
This routine is useful if you are building a web interface that
supports the JS9 menu functions.

<h5 id="JS9.OpenRegionsMenu">Use the file dialog box to load a region file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.OpenRegionsMenu()</code>
<p>
Calling this routine brings up the browser file menu. When a region file is
selected, if will be loaded into the JS9 display.
<p>
This routine is useful if you are building a web interface that
supports the JS9 menu functions.

<h5 id="JS9.OpenColormapMenu">Use the file dialog box to load a colormap file</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.OpenColormapMenu()</code>
<p>
Calling this routine brings up the browser file menu. When a
JSON-format colormap file is selected, it will be loaded into the JS9
display. The colormap file can take one of two forms (without the comments):
<pre>
    # RGB color triplets for the I8 colormap in a "colors" property
    {"name":"i8","colors":[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]}

    # all 3 vertex arrays for the purple colormap in one "vertices" property
    {"name":"purple","vertices":[[[0,0],[1,1]],[[0,0],[0,0]],[[0,0],[1,1]]]}
</pre>
This routine is useful if you are building a web interface that
supports the JS9 menu functions. See
<a href="#JS9.AddColormap"><b>JS9.AddColormap()</b></a> for more
information about colormap formats.

<h5 id="JS9.GetToolbar">Get toolbar values from the Toolbar plugin</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">val = JS9.GetToolbar(type)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>type</b>: type of information to retrieve
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>val</b>: array of tool objects (or an argument-dependent return)
</ul>
The <b>JS9.GetToolbar()</b> routine returns global information about the Toolbar
plugin. If the first argument is "showTooltips", the returned value specifies
whether tooltips are currently displayed. Otherwise an array of tool objects is
returned, one for each of the defined tools in the toolbar.

<h5 id="JS9.SetToolbar">Set toolbar values for the Toolbar plugin</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.SetToolbar(arg1, arg2)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>arg1</b>: a type-dependent id or value to set
<li><b>arg2</b>: a type-dependent value to set
</ul>
The <b>JS9.SetToolbar()</b> routine sets global information about the Toolbar
plugin. The following values can be specified as the first argument:
<ul>
<li><b>init</b>: the text "init" triggers a re-initialization of all
display Toolbar plugins, which is useful if you have changed
the <b>JS9.globalOpts.toolBar</b> array to specify a new set of
top-level tools.
<li><b>showTooltips</b>: the text "showTooltips" uses the value of the
boolean arg2 to specify whether tooltips are displayed as the mouse hovers
over a tool.
<li><b>[text]</b>: other text is assumed to be a JSON-formatted text
containing either a new tool to add to the toolbar, or an array of tools.
<li><b>[object]</b>: an object is assumed to be new tool to add to the toolbar
<li><b>[array]</b>: an array is assumed to be an array of new tools to add to the toolbar
</ul>
New tools can be added to the toolbar at any time using this routine. The 
text properties associated with a tool object are:
<ul>
<li><b>name</b>: name of the tool
<li><b>tip</b>: a tooltip to display when the mouse hovers over the tool
<li><b>image</b>: url (relative to the install directory) containing a PNG
image file to display as the tool icon
<li><b>cmd</b>: name of the JS9 public routine to execute when the tool is
clicked
<li><b>args</b>: array of arguments to pass to the JS9 public routine
</ul>
Only the name and cmd properties are required. If no image is
specified, a button labeled by the name value will be used.

<p>
Examples of tool objects:
<pre>
  {
    "name": "linear",
    "tip": "linear scale",
    "image": "images/toolbar/dax_images/lin.png",
    "cmd": "SetScale",
    "args": ["linear"]
  },
  {
    "name": "histeq",
    "tip": "histogram equalization",
    "cmd": "SetScale",
    "args": ["histeq"]
  },
  {
    "name": "annulus",
    "tip": "annulus region",
    "image": "images/toolbar/dax_images/annulus.png",
    "cmd": "AddRegions",
    "args": ["annulus"]
  },
  {
    "name": "remove",
    "tip": "remove selected region",
    "image": "images/toolbar/dax_images/erase.png",
    "cmd": "RemoveRegions",
    "args": ["selected"]
  },
  {
    "name": "zoom1",
    "tip": "zoom 1",
    "image": "images/toolbar/dax_images/mag_one.png",
    "cmd": "SetZoom",
    "args": [1]
  },
  {
    "name": "magnifier",
    "tip": "toggle magnifier display",
    "image": "images/toolbar/dax_images/mag.png",
    "cmd": "DisplayPlugin",
    "args": ["JS9Magnifier"]
  }
</pre>
Each time a tool is added to the list of available tools, the active
Toolbar plugins will be re-initialized to display that tool. By default,
the new tool not be added to the top-level list: you must also edit
the <b>JS9.globalOpts.toolBar</b> array to add the name of the
tool. If this is done after you add the tool, remember to re-initialize
active toolbars by calling:
<pre>
    JS9.SetToolbar("init");
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.InstallDir">Get location of JS9 installation directory</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">rpath = JS9.InstallDir(file)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>file</b>: file or directory to convert
</ul>
returns:
<ul>
<li><b>rpath</b>: path of the file relative to the JS9 install directory
</ul>
Sometimes a plugin needs to load an auxiliary file inside the plugins
sub-directory. The web page loading the plugin has an arbitrary
location relative to the JS9 install directory, so this routine
returns a relative path to the js9 install directory.

<h5 id="JS9.Send">Send a message to a back-end server</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.Send(msg, obj, cb)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>msg</b>: name of the msg, as defined in the back-end server
<li><b>obj</b>: object containing msg parameters
<li><b>cb</b>: callback to call when back-end server returns its results
</ul>
JS9 sends various internal messages to the back-end server using either
socket.io protocol (in the Node.js implementation) or CGI. For
example, when a remote analysis call is made, JS9 sends a message to the
back-end server detailing the task to call, parameters to pass, etc. Results
are then returned to JS9 for display. JS9 also sends messages to the
back-end server when a new image is displayed.
<p>
Communication with the back-end is usually done behind the scenes and
need not concern users or application programmers. However, if you
write your own socket.io-based server, you might want to add
project-specific messages to your implementation. For example, a
Perl-based or Python-based server might add its own special messages
that execute Perl or Python commands within the server in response to
JS9 messages. In this case, you can use
<a href="#JS9.Send"><b>JS9.Send()</b></a>
to send a message to these message handlers.
<p>
The <b>msg</b> name is the name of the message, as defined by the
server. By convention, an object is usually passed to the
message handler. JS9 will add a <b>dataPath</b> property to this
object to indicate the current list of directories in which to
search for data. All other properties are specific to the message being handled.
You can pass a null instead of an object and
<a href="#JS9.Send"><b>JS9.Send()</b></a>
will generate
a temporary object to hold the dataPath.
<p>
The <b>cb</b> function will be called if the message sends an
acknowledgment.  The arguments passed to this function call by the server
are specific to the message being handled.
<p>
For example, you can send a message to the back-end server to retrieve the
list of available analysis tasks and then display this list using the call:
<pre>
    JS9.Send("getAnalysis", null, function(s){alert(s)});
</pre>
The "getAnalysis" message passes no parameters to the server. The
server returns a list of available analysis tasks in JSON format.

<h5 id="JS9.AddDivs">Add a JS9 display div and/or associated plugins</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.AddDivs(id1, id2, ...)</code>
<p>
where:
<ul>
<li><b>id1, id2, ...</b>: optional name(s) of new JS9 display div(s)
</ul>
You can add new JS9 displays and/or plugins dynamically. To do this, you
create the new divs, add them to the web page, and then call this routine to
incorporate them into JS9.
<p>
The routine will accept a list of JS9 display divs to initialize.  If
all you are doing is adding one or more plugins to an existing display,
leave the argument list empty.
<p>
For example, to add a new JS9 display and menubar at the end of a web
page and load an image into that display:
<pre>
    var html = "&lt;div class='JS9Menubar' id='myJS9Menubar'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='JS9' id='myJS9'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";
    // jquery append to end of page
    $(html).appendTo($("body"));
    // create the new JS9 display, with associated plugins
    JS9.AddDivs("myJS9");
    // just a standard load to that display
    JS9.Load("foo.fits", {scale: "log"}, {display: "myJS9"});
</pre>
You can use <a href="#JS9.LoadWindow"><b>JS9.LoadWindow()</b></a> to
load images into a light-weight or completely new window. To do this
with your own routine, you should call JS9.AddDivs() after the window
has been created. You can use the jQuery
<a href="https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive" target="_blank">arrive</a>
wrapper that implements support for the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver" target="_blank"> MutationObserver</a>:
<pre>
    // once the window exists containing the div id, we can finish the set up
    $("#window").arrive("#"+id, {onceOnly: true}, function(){
        finishUp();
    });
    // (make-believe) create light win routine, where id is the window div id
    myCreateLightWindow(id, html, title, opts);
</pre>

<h5 id="JS9.InstantiatePlugins">Instantiate plugins on this web page</h5>
<p>
<code class="api">JS9.InstantiatePlugins()</code>
<p>
Normally, JS9 will instantiate all of its plugins automatically once the page
is loaded and ready: internally, jQuery $(document).ready() calls JS9.init().
However, module loaders such as <a href="http://requirejs.org" target="_blank">Require.js</a>
can load scripts asynchronously and cause jQuery $(document).ready() to fire
before all JS9 scripts are available. The
<a href="#JS9.RegisterPlugin"><b>JS9.RegisterPlugin()</b></a>
routine should deal properly with this situation. But just in case ...
the <b>JS9.InstantiatePlugins()</b> will perform the plugin instantiation 
explicitly.
<p>
In you find you need to call this routine in order make your in-page
plugins display properly, please let us know the circumstances.

<h4 id="history">API Change History</h4>
  
<p>
The JS9 Public API is meant to be stable and well-documented. If we are
forced to make an incompatible change to the API, it will be documented here.

<p>
<h5>20200815: ChangeRegions, CopyRegions, GetRegions, RemoveRegions, SelectRegions, : default region changed</h5>
If the <b>regions</b> argument is not specified, it now defaults to
"selected" if there are selected regions, otherwise "all". Previously it only
default to "all". You can revert to the previous behavior by changing the
JS9.globalOpts.regWhichDefault from "auto" to "all". (Note: unless you are
writing a GUI, you almost certainly should be specifying the regions explicitly
for these calls).

<h5>20200720: ChangeRegions: dx, dy properties renamed to deltax, deltay</h5>

The <b>dx, dy</b> properties of <a href="#JS9.ChangeRegions">
JS9.ChangeRegions</a> allowed you to specify a delta to add to the current
image position. For consistency, these properties were renamed to
<b>deltax, deltay</b> respectively.

<h5>20200623: SetFlip and SetRot90 no longer manipulate the image data</h5>
The original implementation of <a href="#JS9.SetFlip">JS9.SetFlip</a>
and <a href="#JS9.SetRot90">JS9.SetRot90</a> manipulated the
underlying image data, changing the WCS as needed. This behavior was
inconsistent with other routines: e.g. image processing routines
only change the displayed data, while explicit raw data routines such as
<a href="#JS9.ReprojectData">JS9.ReprojectData</a> change the underlying
image in accordance with the rules for manipulating raw data. We therefore
re-implemented these routines (and added <a href="#JS9.SetRotate">JS9.SetRotate</a>)
so that they change the orientation of the canvas, rather than the
underlying image data.  This implies that the WCS headers are no longer
changed by flipping and rotating.

<h5>20200207: remove DisplaySection +N and -N binning options</h5>

<p>
The DisplaySection() routine originally supported "+N" and "-N"
binning options to change the current bin by "N". With the addition of
support for fractional binning, these two constructs conflict with the
use of negative bin values to indicate 1/abs(N) binning.


<h5>20200114: Remove experimental LoadAuxFile routine</h5>

<p>
Regions can be loaded using <a href="#JS9.LoadRegions">JS9.LoadRegions</a>.
Masks are now supported by loading a mask image and calling
<a href="#JS9.MaskImage">JS9.MaskImage</a>. 

<h5>20180322: DisplaySection now uses current values for unspecified properties</h5>

<p>
Prior to JS9 version 2.1,
<a href="#JS9.DisplaySection"><b>JS9.DisplaySection()</b></a> always used
the center of the file, along with dimensions and binning specified by
the JS9.globalOpts.table and JS9.globalOpts.image objects, if these
properties were not explicitly specified. This was just wrong: it
meant that you could not set up a section and then repeated change the
filter or position without re-specifying the current section
parameters. We therefore changed the default behavior so that unspecified
properties take on the current values. To use the original defaults,
simply specify 0 for xcen and ycen, and use the globalOpts values
for dimensions and binning.

<h5>20151218: OpenFileMenu and OpenRegionsMenu don't require a display argument</h5>

<p>
The routines
<a href="#JS9.OpenFileMenu"><b>JS9.OpenFileMenu()</b></a>
and
<a href="#JS9.OpenRegionsMenu"><b>JS9.OpenRegionsMenu()</b></a>
required a display argument, instead of utilizing the standard
optional display object. This mistake has been corrected, with the
result that both routines now target the default display, as expected,
if no display is passed.

<h5>20141117: The Set routines now return "OK" instead of true on success</h5>

<p>
The public Set routines
(<a href="#JS9.SetZoom"><b>JS9.SetZoom()</b></a>,
<a href="#JS9.SetColormap"><b>JS9.SetColormap()</b></a>, etc)
were returning a boolean true when successful. This has been changed
to "OK", to make it clear that the return value is a status value,
not a boolean data value.

<h5>20141028: callback function to RunAnalysis and SubmitAnalysis</h5>

<p>
Due to an oversight, the signature of the callback function supplied to
<a href="#JS9.RunAnalysis"><b>JS9.RunAnalysis()</b></a>
(and its derivative function, 
<a href="#JS9.SubmitAnalysis"><b>JS9.SubmitAnalysis()</b></a>)
was missing the errcode argument. 
To correct this mistake, the signature was changed from:
<pre>
    func(stdout, stderr, aobj)
</pre>
to:
<pre>
    func(stdout, stderr, errcode, aobj)
</pre>
See js9onchange.html for an example of using this callback function.
